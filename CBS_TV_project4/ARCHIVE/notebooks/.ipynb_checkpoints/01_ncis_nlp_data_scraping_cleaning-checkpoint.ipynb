newly departed milady the heat of the explosion fused something onto his shirt  it looks like plastic  ooh maybe a credit card ill check any luck with the bomb i was able to determine that the explosive was  and based on the size of the blast id think it was probably to ounces that would explain the extensive trauma to the building managers body any luck locating the lieutenant agent mcgee unfortunately no i dont believe ive ever seen you wearing a scarf before  im confused keith isnt in fort wayne his mother hasnt seen or talked to him she isnt expecting him i dont know what to tell you agent gibbs  why would he lie i dont know anything at work that could put him in danger no his duties are primarily administrative he doesnt have topsecret clearance i cant believe someone would try to kill him hes quiet keeps to himself what can you tell me about lieutenant keiths personal life not much matter of fact i dont think ive seen him outside the office  is he good at his job adequate he doesnt have his heart in it once keith washed out of flight school i think he was just riding his time out offered him a job that would put him on a career track he wasnt interested  he give a reason no hes a strange duck how do you mean i just cant get a handle on the guy  so this is mmhm vera ive seen your face on that screen more times than i can remember wow i didnt realize it

of trouble  how do you know him met him in pensacola for  we moved on together to whiting field for preliminary flight training  you two close no just classmates why did he wash out he was actually a good pilot the pressure got to him pressure huh terry probably needed to be on some kind of antianxiety medication but you cant do that and fly he started acting out  there a confrontation no last weeks of flight training terry knew he wasnt gonna make the cut he became sullen and withdrawn and angry with me i dont think he could accept the fact that a woman was going to move on to strikejet training and he wasnt the call the other day what did he want couldnt figure it out it was strange he was strange we werent on the best of terms when he left whiting field and now he wants to see me before i deploy what did you tell him i was busy i needed to see friends and family before i shipped out why dont you handle this one dinozzo okay hey there you larry purcell whos asking  special

lieutenant keith the  he never told me his name and i didnt know he was in the navy  whatd you think he was gonna do with explosives he said he was gonna do some demo work on a friends farm  and you believed him i believed the cash he gave me i had no idea he was gonna rig his apartment and kill somebody  a little help would be nice mcgee sorry  is it broken a severe ankle sprain  youre lucky lucky  what happens now  youll be held in a detention facility and booked for accessory to murder illegal sale of explosives and assaulting two federal officers  two federal officers yeah me and agent strickland that old broad is an agent i just need one minute with that clown  can i make some kind of a deal unless you can tell us where keith is youve got nothing do i get a break if i sign a confession write it all down  and please be specific we estimate he used to ounces of  how much did you sell him ounces i sold him pounds thats almost as much as was used to take out the cole in yemen  what are we dealing with keith has something big planned agreed but why did he rig his own apartment whoever comes to investigate after the fact take him out leon wouldnt be the first time keith didnt know the building manager was gonna open that door prematurely gibbs what whats his ultimate target i dont know i gotta notify homeland  and the so gibbs your golden gut was right i finally got into keiths hard drive for the last year hes been buying prescription antidepressants online from a canadian pharmacy using an assumed name selfmedicating and also this plastic blob that was melted on the apartment managers shirt it is not a credit card it is actually an  private pilots license newly issued and sent by registered mail to lieutenant keith two days ago letter the manager was gonna put in keiths apartment no good deed goes unpunished lieutenant keith took his final check ride for a civilian pilots license two weeks ago at a small airport in rural virginia lafayette field his instructor was kip logan  dinozzo on my way boss  wanna take a ride vera bite me keith was the best student i ever had didnt have to teach him anything the navy did that qualifying him was a nobrainer once he passed the written exam and logged the minimum hours i issued him a temporary certificate and filed the paperwork with the seen him recently  yesterday checked him out in a  he wanted to rent whats that stol short takeoff and landing twoseater lot of fun to fly you can land them anywhere pasture field its great for crosscountry trips  did he rent it yeah he booked it for two days  he say where he was going didnt tell me we pulled the radar and security footage from lafayette field for yesterday afternoon the plane lieutenant keith rented took off at  it circled the field then headed in a southwesterly direction three minutes later it dropped below radar coverage did it ever pop up on the radar again no a  has the capability to fly very low and very slow itd be like finding a needle in a haystack so potentially we have a bomb aboard an airplane on a suicide mission with an unknown target alert all agents and analysts no one leaves until we find lieutenant keith thank you sweetheart you have just made my day im out of here oh that was  and because of my lineofduty injury i dont have to come in anymore and i have you to thank for that dinozzo  well it was my pleasure oh  here let me help you with that no dont back back dont you come near me  just a back i said back you catch that  before he hurts anybody else probie well see you around vera you know im gonna have a lot of time on my hands maybe ill drop by see what youre working on in the basement front door still unlocked  just put it around no i said no dont touch me back off  come on come on come on back to work keith took off hours ago where is he  call you next week yes boss  stationed at lafayette field in case he returns hes not going back there trust me is this what you lost mcgee  where did you find them director they were found at  stadium police turned them in to the s office i dont know what to say  gibbs you know this yeah ill deal with it later been a little busy around here leon  anything on lieutenant keith no nothing on his location ducky profiled him we have a theory  all right lets go were briefing the others in five minutes duck yeah i need you in  told you youd find them yeah in the inspector generals office im completely screwed well airtraffic controllers are on full alert we havent had any sightings whats the planes range  just under nautical miles so if keith is planning to go any further hell have to stop to refuel all general aviation airports east of the mississippi have been notified what do we know about lieutenant keith weve profiled him dr mallard lieutenant keith was bullied as a youth and looked to naval aviation to turn his life around unfortunately he washed out that made him depressed and rather than seeking professional help he selfmedicated we believe that he quit cold turkey to pass his  medical exam and to get his civilian pilots license an abrupt cessation of medication of that type could most definitely lead to episodes of delusion and paranoia that altered state combined with low selfesteem and rejection well most likely hes seeking revenge  revenge against whom were aware of two possibilities the high school where he was bullied or whiting field where he washed out and both have been alerted we cant limit ourselves to those two targets could be anywhere so how did it go with the adoption lawyer okay he had a problem with one of the items on our rsum what breenas a mortician im a medical examiner we both work with dead people and the lawyer seemed to think that that might be kind of a turnoff for a young woman putting her baby up for adoption but you know i think itll be fine im feeling really optimistic you should be because as soon as they get to know you two theyre gonna love you thank you for saying that hey mcgee  hey mcgee well i got my creds back  great where were they someone found them at investigation to follow i could end up getting time on the beach or worse mcgee oh im so so so sorry ugh i feel totally responsible i begged you to go to that concert with me  its not your fault  oh god now its just ruined what would have gone down in history as the most epic night ever have you seen twitter the sterile puppets have now gone viral oh yeah i heard they passed million followers what how good a friend of yours is the drummer  why think hed do you a favor  will you slow down mcgee i do not understand a word you are saying in english theres a way of finding the plane if its flying under the radar social networking gibbs twitter mc abbys got a friend in a band and every single one of their tweets is being followed by hundreds of thousands of fans we post a picture of keiths plane and ask the fans to be on the lookout and if anyone sees it then we tell them to tweet the location with the hashtag findthisplane whats a hashtag thousands of sterile puppets fans will be on the lookout for this plane hashtag this could work boss go oh we got our first hit its from hopewell virginia  admiral sending you the coordinates now  ill alert  here we go  s tried to make contact keith isnt answering might have the radios turned off  transponders too were not getting any radar hits mc another tweet  the last time we heard from keith it was on the  frequency from lafayette field  can we transmit on that frequency itll take a minute weve scrambled two hornets from oceana to make an intercept  armed yes but we cant bring the plane down over a populated area were getting a lot of tweets hes flying a zigzag course mc we got another hes skirting around towns weve got a video attached thats brilliant whose idea was it to track the plane on twitter i know where hes headed the benjamin franklin just left its still in the bay im monitoring the fighter pilots transmissions  theyre closing in put it on a speaker target has crossed the shoreline and is less than one minute from the benjamin franklin were circling back were circling back several of keiths aviation classmates are on board for their first deployment mc lieutenant robbins the woman that keiths been trying to get in contact with the ultimate blow to his ego she gets to fly attack fighters and he doesnt have  alert the ship five thousand personnel over aircraft and a billion ship  hell of a statement hes never gonna get near it its protected by stateoftheart airandsurface defense

backup no maam would that be a violation of lapd policy yes it would how long have you been partners  years and during that time have you known detective bosch to violate lapd policy on occasion its not that cut and dry sometimes you have to react a little in the moment to manage the situation at hand and have you known detective bosch to react in the moment as you call it well yeah i guess that

called it in i was showing the officer here the highlighted area is a growthplate line if we compare it to the recovered specimen this is a childs bone detective no doubt about it  childs bone yes how long have you been retired doctor it doesnt mean i dont know a human bone when i see one im not questioning your expertise you say its a human bone i believe you okay im just trying to get the lay of the land here did you happen to see where she found it i didnt way up in the hill somewhere in the woods beautiful dog golden retriever right  whats her name calamity you guys can clear out i can take it from here  keep it off the air roger that so what can you tell me about it  see the striation mmhmm thats a break line detective a healed fracture broken and mended a spiral fracture usually from severe twisting of the limb rotation break yes rotation break rarely accidental i know going up to take a look give it a try maybe an hour or so of daylight left julia brasher im new in the division harry bosch yeah i know ive heard of you i deny everything uh look sorry about butting in with the doctor in there i know you were trying to establish rapport and my timings a bit off today dont worry

a bitch sorry wish i could write you something for the pain but since i retired no dont worry about it doc i can deal with it you said theres a crime scene up there i found more bones thought i was looking at twigs at first then i realized i was looking at a hand a childs hand a childs hand why arent you answering your cell  died an hour ago mine hasnt i come out of the movies i got messages from everybody from the watch commander to the coroners office telling me about some bone case youre working up in the hills i was gonna call you just wanted to check missing persons first unauthorized possession of departmental property i could bust you on this alone bosch yeah i guess you could what i really want to know is who gave you permission to take johnson and moores rotation they had lakers tickets i just offered you gave them the lakers tickets yeah yeah i guess i did youre in court on monday morning harry do you have any idea how fucked up this is i do but i can handle it you need to focus on your court case detective your future is on the line anybody can sue anybody in this world the department cleared me do you think that if a jury decides that you killed an unarmed man that that it ends there just because its civil he wasnt unarmed well if chandler convinces them that he was do you think for one second that irving wont take you off of the homicide table youll be doing auto theft in san pedro living on poptarts and instant ramen in a rented room okay look first of all lieutenant we dont even know what we have up there it could be decades old look exactly which is why on monday  this goes to cold case no it stays with me i caught it i keep it its a hobby case lieutenant we excavate the site tomorrow and then we evaluate i could be finished with this court bullshit before we even get forensics back god damn it i need the work lieutenant this is the work i do you know this i know that if the captain sees your name on the reports hell be shitting blood tell the captain you got edgar working it while im in court ill put his name on everything harry harry harry all right look just take a look at this this is what were looking for in terms of color spread an arms distance apart in one line and move slowly across each quadrant slowly got it take your time this aint a contest we got all day  all right come on lets go yes sir hey heard you need volunteers we could use you check in with my partner over there roger that found more bones definitely a grave site so its a homicide i cant think of a legit reason to bury a body up here especially a kid right femur city of bones the grid we laid down is like the blocks of a city so we know exactly what was found where and every murder is the tale of a city who said that i dont know somebody think its true yeah i do detective bosch  found it near the left wing of the pelvis probably in our victims pocket pretty good marker it puts us inside years yeah two other things i want to emphasize detective  grave dept hand location terrain go ahead doc well we have a contradiction here it was a shallow grave whoever buried this body basically covered it over with loose dirt and dry leaves which suggests panic poor planning on the other hand a remote location difficult terrain see what im saying  premeditation yeah decomp fluid shave destroyed the clothing but the canvas backpack is largely intact so maybe burying it with the body was a mistake maybe waistband from a pair of boys underwear pelvis assembly also indicates we may have a male here judging from the skeletal remains a child of about or  give me the trowel brush missing lower mandible no teeth on the upper dental id would be too easy dont despair detective cranium shows clear evidence of fracture line sand surgical healing hospital records another indicator were dealing with relatively contemporary bones stellate fracture on the occipital bluntforce trauma thats the most likely explanation ill

college travel law school lawyer lawyer check please it didnt last very long it was just a couple of years at my dads law firm must have been pretty bad you trade a briefcase for a billy club it wasnt bad just boring so this is it dream come true  for now yeah right who could resist all this police work its so glamorous do your job risk your life they drag you into court try to make you look like ted bundy when the other guy really is ted bundy you worried about the trial im not worried about what i did i know what i did was right im worried about what the jury will think i did anyway fuck it hows your martini spectacular this is a great place old la theres not much of it left whered you get those long story i still think its one of the last noble callings what police work homicide what you do homicides dull after the fact somebody takes somebody elses life we show up doesnt sound dull to me seriously you take some genuinely evil people off the board sometimes when we get lucky no i think theres more to it than luck and it counts you know what you do it counts shit crap i hate mondays man you and me both brother shit seriously yeah im quitting for real we resume today where we left off friday ms chandlers direct examination of detective bosch you suspected mr flores of killing several women is that correct  he was one of a number of suspects yes how many victims three were certain of possibly several more and how many suspects were you investigating in connection with these murders the task force was investigating over a dozen or so roughly a dozen or so and you personally my partner and i were charged with investigating roberto flores  did mr flores have a criminal record no had he ever even been arrested on any charge no was mr flores ever arrested for these murders  you know he wasnt your honor please answer the question detective  no and why is that he died before he could be taken into custody  you killed him he drew a gun on me so you say his weapon was found at the scene  was his  found on that weapon no was it ever tied to him  forensically in any way no is it possible someone else placed that weapon at the scene  after you shot and killed him no  objection sustained lets turn to something you can prove was there a pattern to these victims did they share any similarities they were all young asian or hispanic darkhaired similar height body type  and who were they they were never identified you dont know their real names  we do not and why is that it was our supposition they were illegals working as prostitutes their bodies had been stripped of all identification and we were never able to make any kind of forensic matches and no one ever came forward  to identify them or claim their remains no  undocumented immigrants that was our assumption  prostitutes as i said our best guess marginal vulnerable women often victimized  preyed upon would you agree yes you have sympathy for them i have sympathy for all the victims of the murders i investigate dont serial killers often target prostitutes as you said theyre vulnerable and dont you have a particular interest in these sorts of crimes a personal interest i take each case as it comes no one case or one kind of case matters to meany more than any other detective what did your mother do for a living she was a prostitute your mother was a prostitute yes is your mother still living no  how old were you when she died  how did she die she was murdered and was her murder ever solved no what happened to you after her murder i went in to the system youth halls foster homes so the killer was never caught never punished no detective when you shot and killed mr flores werent you in effect avenging your mothers death  objection youve got a lot of fucking nerve  im way ahead of you mr belk counselor you know better i apologize your honor detective another outburst like that and ill hold you in contempt im sorry your honor it wont happen again strike that last question and response from the record howd it go chandler ambushed me somebody slipped her my file jesus gollihers ready for us if youre up for it after this bullshit the morgue will be a breath of fresh air we recovered about of the skeleton at the site given the shallow nature of the grave the rest of the remains were no doubt  scattered by animals over the years is that enough  more than enough in this case detective  more than enough tell us what you got doc lets start with the basics young male caucasoid comparison to maresh growth standard indices puts his age at approximately years old but this child was a victim of severe prolonged physical abuse victims of chronic abuse often suffer growth disruption abuserelated stunting that skews age estimation what you get is a skeleton thats smaller than it should be the longlimb bones are shorter than one would expect how old is he really uh i would say best guess or  time of death we have the coin which gives us the early parameter of  so you think hes been in the ground since then  years well we have surgical evidence that supports the estimation of to years cause of death lets save cause of death for last uh but before we get to that i want to give you an idea of what this boy had to endure during his short lifetime all right tell it your way doc well even with partial remains we have definitive proof of tremendous skeletal trauma and chronic abuse bones heal themselves through the study of bone regeneration we can establish a history of abuse on these bones there are multiple lesions and different stages of healing fractures old and new we only have two of the four extremities but both of them show multiple instances of trauma i counted distinct locations indicating separate trauma and various stages of healing jesus christ  and thats just the bones the damage that would have been inflicted on his vital organs and tissue it must have been tremendous without a doubt somebody kicked the shit out of this kid on a daily basis let me show you something the femur the upper thigh this line here where the color changes is one of the lesions this boy suffered a powerful blow in the weeks before his death it didnt break the bone but it damaged it would no doubt have caused bruising and affected his walk somebody must have noticed you would think the right humerus shows two separate and healed breaks one spiral fracture one bucket ah spiral fracture is the result of twisting the arm with great force bucket fracture is a result from pulling the arm with the same kind of violence the ulna the lower arm shows a healed latitudinal fracture a parry fracture the break caused a slight deviation  in the attitude of the bone you want to explain what that means to my partner that means the bone was allowed to heal in place after the injury nobody took him to a doctor apparently not its a common accidental injury but it can also be a defensive one  ward off a blow with the forearm because of the lack of medical attention my supposition is that this was not an accidental injury but rather part of the abuse pattern i got to take a leak keep going sync and correction by solfieri www com  ', ' ive consulted on cases all over the world bosnia kosovo world trade center this is a case maybe this boy was better off leaving this world for a better one do you believe theres a better world than this one i do when you were picking through the bones and burnt flesh at the world trade center that belief work for you then as a matter of fact it did in many ways my faith became stronger it helped me deal with all of that there must be a better place somewhere what else could make sense of this childs torment im a vet doc reupped after  a lot of cops did i was with special forces afghanistan wed go down in these tunnels in these caves pitchblack you turned your head lamp off and there was this glow lost light we called it it was like it was trapped down there with the rest of us so i dont believe theres a better world than this one i think this is the only one we got and its full of lost light it must be very hard to be you and do what you do without faith someone broke nearly every bone in that little boys body and then killed him i cant let that go bosch  lost light sync and correction by solfieri www com need a lift no i dont think so no thanks okay its your loss hey check

thing what is this used for huh that looks to me like you would flip that over a guys head and choke him out ahh what do you think  ive never seen that before really thats funny because we just found that in your van along with a stun gun so how would you do it the guy would fasten his seat belt then youd throw that over his head he gets a little froggy starts kicking and screaming then youd tase him is that how it went i dont do that i i dont do any of that mr waits were gonna charge you with murder so if you have anything to say thatll help clear this up now is the time to tell us yeah sure ill take that lawyer now no shit total bail  broken down resisting without force  for the dui and for the expired drivers license raynard waits is there anything else before me involving mr aronson  no your honor thats me my name is ms kell im with the public defenders office and ill be representing you in this proceeding i want to plead not guilty well you dont enter a plea tonight uh the prosecutor will read the charges against you and the judge will ask you if you understand those charges  you say yes and thats it and what about bail ive got a van a small business and some savings your van was impounded as evidence and youre charged with murder mr waits a bail will be set at a minimum of million a bonds gonna cost you of said bail nonrefundable if you had that kind of money i wouldnt be here this is unfair i have to get out i got a business  there are people i take care of im sorry i cant stay here you understand do your fucking job i got things to do dont we all you better get yourself under control when the judge calls your case  the clothes were folded very neatly in the backpack three of everything shirts pairs of socks pants underwear  kid was on his way somewhere whats that starshaped thing san diego aquarium now the brand name on two of the shirts is solid surf and the backpack has got skateboard straps so maybe the kid was into that and theres a letter handwritten ink pretty bad shape well dry it out try some dyes different lights  but dont get your hopes up perfect murderedkid mystery press will be all over this look we dont want this backpack stuff  in the newspaper okay you got it considering my unofficial status you want to handle media relations nothing of value recovered and blah blah blah  not too far from the truth right anything useful from sid nothing that ids the kid  what time are you due in court couple hours can you give us a minute irving called he is less than thrilled with what went on in court yesterday tell him he can kick pounds in the balls for leaking my psych eval to chandler he asked me to talk to you you dont think it was pounds i think it sucks but irvings got a point im not admitting to shooting an unarmed man i didnt if chandler gets paid she doesnt care what you admit irving says you can end this with no admission of guilt  the city will settle the money is the admission you are a stubborn son of a bitch why you hold me in such high esteem who said that i do look im sorry this stuff came out in court about your mom  that was nobodys business im not ashamed of her she had no family no husband she did what she had to do to raise me this is why i hold you in such high esteem because of who she was and what she did the cops didnt give a shit and thats the reason whoever killed her is still in the wind they didnt care so maybe chandlers right maybe on some subconscious level i shot flores to avenge my mother ill pretend i didnt hear that as to the plaintiffs motion to exclude testimony about the evidence collected from mr flores home after his death no testimony concerning mr flores or his putative guilt or innocence shall be permitted do you wish to crossexamine the witness mr belk yes your honor remember harry yes or no not my first twirl around the dance floor counselor good to know detective bosch you testified that mr flores was one of a dozen suspects  in the investigations into these murders yes  was mr flores the leading suspect no did you shoot mr flores because you believed he had killed these three young women  no did you shoot mr flores because you believed that he was a killer of prostitutes no did you shoot mr flores to avenge your mothers death no detective bosch why did you shoot mr flores i shot him because i believed he was about to shoot me and after you shot him did you then place a gun in mr flores hand  so as to retroactively justify your action no was that possibility investigated by the lapd and the district attorneys office and what did they determine that there was no evidence whatsoever that i planted the weapon thank you detective ms chandler redirect yes your honor detective bosch your partner testified that you broke lapd policy when you left him to pursue mr flores were you aware of the lapd policy  regarding foot pursuits yes then why did you do it it was a tactical decision please expound it made sense for one of us to pursue him on foot because we believed that he was headed for the metro a belief that was borne out by his subsequent actions you consciously violated department policy in pursuit of a man you did not think was a killer your honor asked and answered sustained ms chandler is there a question one further matter detective when you saw mr flores enter that alley that night why did you pursue him why didnt you cal land wait for backup because of his evasive actions entering the alley i thought flores might be on the prowl for a victim  i didnt want to lose him werent you in fact hoping  for a fatal confrontation that night no werent you in fact hoping to provoke mr flores to act in such a way that would justify shooting him no werent you in fact convinced despite your testimony that roberto flores was the killer of these three prostitutes no  whoa i dont pay no income tax  make too much  howd it go i held my own i think  boy nicholas trent lewd and lascivious  you talked to him on the canvass  he didnt make an impression guess he forgot to tell me he was a convicted child molester it was a question jerry not a judgment how should we do this you take lead i may wander this is not a good time im late for an appointment mr trent if you knew wed find out about your past why didnt you tell detective edgar about it it creates suspicion you can understand that that was years ago people change and the sooner you convince us of that the sooner well clear you and move on wheres a comfortable place we can talk mr trent right here in the hall is fine  you mind if we sit my back is it all right with you if i take some notes mr trent i guess so do you have a bathroom i might use mr trent up the stair sand to the right thank you can we hurry this up please lets get started mr trent you know you have no obligation to speak to me today well if thats so then why are you sitting in my living room have you ever seen any unusual activity on the hillside not really kids used to play up there you watched them play what are you insinuating nothing at all sir no i didnt watch them play i stayed away from kids after my trouble id see them go up the hill when i walked my dog any kids in particular no there were always kids around they used to go up there and smoke cigarettes we were always worried that they would set the whole hillside on fire we the residents my neighbors and i  thats for my work detective stuff for boys to  im a set decorator for the movies and you have no right to be down here going through my things  you dont have a search warrant you can see how it might look suspicious for someone with your history it breaks my heart what happened to that little boy do you know what happened to that little boy mr trent no i dont would you be willing to take a polygraph of course i suppose i should call my lawyer we need to get a warrant it makes my skin crawl the animal heads does that guy look like a biggame hunter to you so we just pull his arrest report find out exactly what he did to that kid he molested and go from there break in the case detectives you got a suspect is that a no comment why not give me words and forest all the speculation that might result from interviewing this guys neighbors mr tyler were finishing a routine canvass of the neighborhood the resident shave been cooperative but we have no leads or suspects whatsoever at this time thats all i can tell you  minutes baker and a gruesome development in the case of a hollywood man arrested after police discovered a body in the back of his van

you crossed the tube mmhmm it was a domestic husband had locked himself in the bedroom with a  so edgewood had a shotgun kiko and i have the door kiko kicks it open we go in guys passed out on the bed it seemed like no problem and you dont remember getting in front of edgewoods gun look if i did kiko did too and edgewood didnt say jack to him youre the rookie yeah well its not just that what else is it  its cause im a woman come on im telling you he has a problem im just tired of patrol harry  im sick of it four months in it feels like were putting bandaids on bullet holes everybody goes through that look you want to be a detective right so bad i can taste it there are no shortcuts you got to walk before you run you mean pay my dues were you trying case sat your daddys law firm after four months yeah as a matter of fact i was okay bad example look first couple of years are tough you pick your battles and it works out thats what i did today i took some initiative like youve done your whole career yeah but im the notorious insubordinate harry bosch youre just a salty boot i am kind of salty i can tell did the assholes run away from you harry no you told them to sit down i bet they sat the fuck down most of the time they did yeah they sat the fuck down i know they did oh fuck  oh am i hurting you no in a good way  should i stop immediately mm swept me off my feet harry so you do take me seriously as a cop yeah why do you ask im glad you take me seriously pretty nice view for a cop its a long story paramount paid me a lot of money they made a movie the black echo based loosely on one of my cases very loosely hes much better looking thanks the movie was crap but it paid for this view can you stay is this the one they talk about well its the only bullet hole ive got who talks about it i heard it fasttracked you to detective bullshits bullshit even from cops what about these you were gonna tell me about that remember i never said that i said its a long story jerk lets talk about some of your defects for a minute lets start with that hideous mole behind your ear which one this one whos that thats my daughter whats her name madeline maddie shes pretty  thanks she gets that from her mother obviously didnt tell me you guys had a suspect we dont registered sex offender lives down the hill from the boys bones oh shit no you press you have to okay you do it oh jesus christ i should have planned this a little better i dont care who knows or what they say im a dthree supervisor level im not supposed to be sleeping with my what are you my my underling thats kind of sexy but no i think the word in the manual is subordinate you read the manual yeah i was a lawyer if it eases your mind any you not being in my chain of command mitigates the impropriety jesus you did read the manual nobody reads the manual okay then keep this between us subordinate yes sir now discovery doesnt begin until you enter a plea but based on what we know from the arrest report the preliminary observations by the coroner and the charging documents i think we can start formulating a strategy can i get copies of all that uh i would recommend against it you dont want this floating around in jail the wrong person gets a look at it theyll snitch you off in a heartbeat make it sound like you gave up every detail i didnt kill that young man a man was found dead  in a vehicle owned and operated by you yeah and the preliminary coroners investigation calls his death asphyxiation by strangulation yeah thats terrible but i didnt do it well it only gets worse from there mr waits they found the hood and the taser those are tools that i use in my business and then theres the  blood hair semen collected from the victims body as well as but that proves it im not gay so its got to be somebody else as well as the van and the hood multiple distinct  samples look my point is if even one of those samples from the hood or the van is matched to another murder or a missing person multiple victims makes you eligible for the death penalty so what do i do you sit tight we enter a plea see whats in discovery maybe we get lucky and find something that we can challenge what if i had something what do you mean something to give the da something i think hed want how old was your son when he disappeared what was his name and when was he reported missing thank you for your call well be in touch if there are any new developments texas eight years ago female  no im telling you they do not mean the same thing help us out harry crate thinks that the wellknown injunction not

commander one other thing yes edgewood she screwed up harry because she gives a fuck mank doesnt sit in the car waiting for the box to tell her what to do well you ought to know from what i hear you know about her giving a fuck i mean really you too do you know what they say about the company dock okay all right ill talk to edgewood before he papers it thanks deputy district attorney escobar why are we here my client wants to help you clear up several homicides in which he was involved and in exchange he gets to maximize his exposure a life without parole no death penalty correct we have  from your van as many as seven possible victims why would i make a deal before we get the science back and see what unsolveds we can match it to and we have the body from the van you need mr waits to

captain pounds bosch thinks that captain pounds gave money chandler a copy of his confidential board of rights file thats a serious allegation lieutenant bosch believes it and that makes it so we need officers to trust that the board of rights hearings are actually confidential or they wont cooperate and good shooting or not they are required to make a statement and talk to a department shrink to then have their personal background thrown at them in open court is bullshit sir ill take it under advisement lieutenant im his partner what is this regarding do you have information about the case

start upstairs jerry that stuff in trents note about his children  mmhmm found them every month  bucks here there for years making up for what he did killing that boy  seeking redemption why not you really think hes our guy  hes a child molester doesnt make him a killer they all start somewhere yeah they do mr trent was a pedophile with a criminal record he lived in close proximity to the burial site of a murdered child after being questioned by investigators he committed suicide whether mr trent was responsible for the death of the victim is pending further investigation given that the  is being blamed for trents suicide i think we can agree this press release will do nothing to help our situation its accurate we still dont know trent killed that kid now if we could modify the release indicate we think theres a good probability trent was the killer wed get the stink off pin the murder on the dead perv and walk away with a disney ending jesus christ bosch detective were not gonna pin the murder on anyone what makes you think trents not our guy this child was physically abused every day of his life more than likely the killer was someone close to him a family member a friend a neighbor billets told me you found photos of kids he supported childrens charities solicitations the kind you get in the mail  a day sends a bolivian kid to school we also found a box of tweener boys stuff  toys games trent was a set decorator he had all kinds of stuff in his house maybe im missing something but it seems to me all of this points to trent okay case closed lets all go get a beer go with the press release asis dont be confused whatever the defense would have you believe this case is not about a serial killer this case is only about the fatal shooting of a man named roberto flores a loving husband and father who was shot to death one rainy october evening two years ago by detective harry bosch roberto flores was unarmed roberto flores offered no resistance roberto flores had no criminal record detective bosch could have arrested roberto flores that night taken him into custody read him his rights interrogated him given him the chance to obtain counsel and defend himself instead detective bosch for deeply personal reasons of his own and in violation of  procedure and policy deprived roberto flores of due process deprived him of his civil rights and took his life ladies and gentlemen its very clear detective bosch under color of law broke every rule in the book when he killed roberto flores in cold blood thank you mr belk ladies and gentlemen when detective bosch encountered roberto flores in that dark rainy alley two years ago he had to make a splitsecond decision for us to secondguess his actions now is impossible and unfair we werent there we didnt have to make that lifeordeath decision now mr flores ignored detective boschs orders to put up his hands and keep them in plain sight he ignored detective boschs orders to freeze and mr flores was armed no one planted that gun in that alley that night that gun belonged to mr flores and no one else ooh merci beaucoup whats the occasion thanks for not getting her shitcanned i have no idea what youre talking about detective but i appreciate the brioche anything on the tip line yes there is um a guy from hemet called apparently the remains are extraterrestrial also uh sheila delacroix her brother arthur delacroix went missing in when he was years old  surgeries yes cranial surgery six months before he went missing he fell off his skateboard and cracked his skull  follow up with that then all right harry brasher two unsats i mean shes your friend you might i should have a talk with her yeah good idea  all right thanks be safe so on the news this morning an unnamed  source says that despite official denials nicholas trent is in fact responsible for the laurel canyon murder which is why he committed suicide  unnamed source yeah you got any ideas who knows tell you one thing its good for irving gets the press off his back how did closing arguments go chandlers good  they are gonna find for you harry yeah well see aint over till the fat lady sings oh speaking of fat ladies

moved back harry vegas is a fourhour drive im working a case you are always working a case when is the last time you saw maddie flew to hong kong for her birthday kids are a happy thing harry even girls who take it from me are hell on their mothers let some light into your life i mean we couldnt minutes stop for a bite heres a novel concept how bout you eat before you come to work i didnt have time dolores called lastminute had to drive over to her place to pick up the kids  mm take them to school yeah ms delacroix im detective bosch my partner detective edgar uh come in thank you uh may  he had gone to school that day and never came home i was  arthur was um my father and i thought he must have run away because he took a backpack with him with some clothes you know tshirts jeans god it got to be about and he hadnt come home we went to look for him and couldnt find him my father brought me home and he went to the police and reported him missing never heard anything back he just vanished off the face of the earth all these years i i just keep thinking you know one day hell just turn up all grown up and happy its always hardest around the holidays im sure what do you do for a living ms delacroix um im a casting director  mostly do you have any pictures of arthur uh yeah that one that thats us on the end that one is uh more close to when he disappeared hes about there these boys do you know their names oh sorry its been a long time you know they were his friends not mine but i do have one more you mind if we take these uh yeah if if you bring them back well make copies where did arthur have his surgery after the accident uh childrens hospital wed like to talk to your father is he still around samuel delacroix hes in the valley manchester trailer park what about your mother oh she left us when we were little woke up one morning she was gone you ever hear from her again not a word but uh she left little notes under our pillows about how much she loved us and how this was the best for everyone and crap like that you still have the note i threw it out you think arthur might have kept his im sure he did pitiful how he hung onto every scrap of her your mothers name her maiden name christine dorsett i dont suppose you know where she is i dont even know if shes alive and i dont care what about a photo no but i do have one of my father oh his old head shot  he was an actor yeah guest shots mostly mannix marcus welby rockford he doesnt look like that anymore drinks this backpack was found at the burial site sorry uh dont remember this was found in the backpack uh sh she gave this to him this was like his favorite treasure he took it with him everywhere he even slept with it was it a souvenir from a family vacation no um we didnt do things like that she probably got it at some dollar store my god it might really be him we dont know for sure yet if we get his medical records we can compare that to his remains these stairs oh yeah uh this is the home we grew up in so youve lived here your whole life well yeah i was afraid if i moved if arthur came back he wouldnt know where to find me  hey doc ah detective bosch  sorry i couldnt come to the station thats okay you might find this interesting she was pulled from the tar years old look familiar  bluntforce trauma uhhuh not the only one we have a skull from another woman killed around the same time with the same stellate starshaped fracture so there was a serial killer in this neighborhood  years ago its quite possible i need you to look at this belonged to a boy named arthur delacroix who went missing in  well lets compare it with the laurel canyon skull the cranial surgeries pretty sure theyre a match sister said the injury came from a skateboarding accident no not likely this is a focused fracture pattern a small area with surfacetosurface contact the location is high upon the cranium not in the back of the head which we normally associate with a fall so this injury the one that required surgery  its the same kind of one that killed him yeah exactly deliberate not accidental in both instances this child was struck with some force with a blunt object  you have a photo of the boy yeah the malar and the superciliary ridge formations are consistent meaning i think this is your victim  comparison with the sister should confirm it you asked me before if i had faith i remember i told you i didnt that wasnt the truth i do i have my own kind of faith blue religion arthur delacroixs bones came out of the ground for a reason they came out of the ground for me to find them so i can put some part of this right thanks doc youre welcome harry harry i checked missing persons from may of  the boys dad never filed a report sheila delacroix said he did maybe he just told her he did what about arthurs mother anything on her what you dont usually refer to the victim by their first name anyway she legally separated from samuel delacroix in  filed for a divorce mental and physical cruelty remarried in  she is now mrs christine waters palm springs bosch ricochet wants to see you asap me why  im sure hell tell you hey lise  great cookies thanks harry whats going on were going christmas shopping hopefully well still be speaking to each other by the end of the day call me on my cell let me know what oshea says how come the da want to see you and not me who knows maybe im being indicted detective bosch thank you for coming you know my chief deputy lou escobar  weve met lou harry have a seat detective are you familiar with the name raynard waits yeah but you should be talking to johnson and moore theyre handling that investigation oh this involves you as well how so i hear youve tentatively identified the laurel canyon victim his name was arthur delacroix he was years old waits confessed to killing him confessed to my case says it was his first with all due respect this guy gets popped with a body in his van and by coincidence confesses to a murder thats a big coincidence and im not buying it this case is all over the news this guy is running a game i dont know maybe he just wants the attention he wants to make a deal claims he buried several other victims up in that canyon says hell tell us where if we take the death penalty off the table life without parole dont do this do not make this deal give him the needle and send him down the hole where he belongs i dont love this either detective but hes offering to tell us about all his victims we found at least seven  profiles in waits van six male one female now this is an opportunity to identify those victims  and to give closure to those families closures a myth well thats for the families to decide isnt it detective why am i here interview waits see if hes telling the truth about killing this kid johnson and moore will give you what they have were all on the same team here detective right windowwashing business since  we pulled and receipts out of that apartment on selma  where hes been living also since  anything there aside from the business records which look legit clean as a nuns bum nobodys  and prints but his what about the victims apartment nada gutierrez shared with two other rent boys they had a rule about not bringing their work home gutierrez was last seen hustling down on la jolla we got a wit who thinks he may have seen him getting into a grayish van with a guy who more or less might have been waits maybe waits lives in hollywood picks up gutierrez in hollywood but gets arrested in echo park i mean if hes looking to dump the body griffith parks a lot closer so whered he live before he lived on selma thats the thing we dont know theres nothing on waits before  and he starts his business no school records tax returns utility bills nothing in he applies for a california drivers license thats the first time hes on the grid anywhere had to have a birth certificate to get a drivers license and the one he gave the  said he was born at hollywood pres but they have no record of it not at the registrars office either theres no record of his birth anywhere in the county so the birth certificates a phony so is the name did you get the coroners report mnhmnh hasnt come in yet lets go over there do you mind hell no ruben gutierrez latino male years of age dead between four and eight hours when the remains were discovered  cause of death he was strangled you see the petechiae and the ligature marks and the xrays showed that the hyoid bone was broken the suspect used a choke hood with a drawstring rope  and the victim was raped were waiting for sid to compare it to the suspects profile about that rape anal penetration resulting in multiple lacerations but no vital reaction  the sex was postmortem correct necrophile mm and a brutal one theres evidence of sodomy by the perpetrator and a metallic foreign object man excuse me this is bosch chief sit  drink no thanks howd it go with oshea bet he handed you some tearyeyed bullshit about giving closure to the victims families he did use the c word yeah well let the healing begin osheas planning a run for mayor so this waits case pure political viagra for him hell get credit for clearing these serial killings and if he clears your bones case too he puts trents suicide on us yeah well too bad an unnamed source put trent out there as the primary suspect were looking into that leak osheas always had it in for the department and if hes elected hell give the ig and the police commission even more power well be under the microscope fucking disaster you dont agree detective politics above my pay grade chief you think waits is telling the truth about killing the boy if he is arthur delacroix is the unluckiest kid that ever lived beaten like a drum every day of his life then done in by some stray serial killer what are the chances  and why would waits lie i dont know i do know hes a lying sack of shit by nature so the odds that hes lying about this are pretty good id say well itd be in both our interests if he were so when you talk to waits see if you cant blow some holes in his confession old house the porch creaks just gonna stand out there all night look im sorry uh the other night i said some things i shouldnt have me too i dont do so good with criticism i was just worried about you  and it came out wrong i know and you were right i was stupid i didnt say that reckless that i said are we good were good hate to tell you harry these scars youll never bean underwear model yeah have to give up that dream kind of sexy though you gonna tell me the story of these or not it was a tattoo had it removed youre a master storyteller spellbinding what was the tattoo hold fast hold fast hold on one hand fast on the other what about this i got shot god its like pulling teeth okay i was chasing some guys what guys bank robbers see good detail makes for a good tale so what happened i went after them into this drainage tunnel it was pitch black couldnt tell exactly

getting shot well it burned like hell everything kind of went numb how long were you down three months light duty i hope they gave you a medal yeah they did youre a hero julia none of that shit

today youre right i dont care i got a bigger nut than you you dont know how easy youve got it irving says osheas grandstanding on this waits thing cause hes running for mayor puts down a serial killer helps him win the election osheas elected mayor irving never makes chief mmhmm never knew you had such a nose for politics jerry fuck you harry your full name birth date and place of birth raynard waits no middle name born november in the city of angels you mean los angeles los angeles you know detective bosch you and i met before years ago i doubt that yeah you you were a patrolman and you gave me a ticket i i was making a right turn and and i rolled the stop sign y you didnt know it but i had a body in the van that day too it was a close call but you did teach me a valuable lesson mind the little things your attorneys proffer suggests the first homicide you committed was arthur delacroix in may of  yeah i didnt know his name at the time but yes he was my first well you never forget your first know what i mean hmph why doesnt he let you ask any questions  a are you just the sidekick fuck off tell us about the day you killed arthur delacroix well i i saw him on the street i was driving down hollywood boulevard its its changed a lot since then hollywood they they hadnt built the kodak theater yet  or fucked up graumans chinese had you seen him before detective bosch i just want to say i really admire you  please just answer the questions mr waits no no i do you know for you to rise above the circumstances of your childhood and become a police officer i mean thats thats a real achievement i like to think ive done the same whyd you pick arthur delacroix um well he was smaller than the rest of the kids that were hanging out on that corner and uh he seemed like he wouldnt be that hard to manage i told him i would take him to the movies he got in the van i doubt that would happen these days kids today are a lot more cautious what happened after you got him in the van i took him to my special place your special place wheres that east la down by the los angeles river i took them all there first there then up the canyon what makes it special oh he speaks i cant explain it you you have to see it to understand and after that what happened at your special place i killed him  did you rape him no  im not a pedophile howd you kill him i strangled him no im sorry that was later after i perfected my approach yeah it was a long time ago i thought you never forget your first itll come to me and after you killed him well i took the body put it in my van drove up to laurel canyon and i buried it oh im taking you up there right  the way this is going id say no aw why why not i im trying to be helpful the detectives need specific details mr waits oh uh ask something specific arthur delacroix had a yoyo with him what color was it  a yoyo yeah what color was it mm  i dont remember you dont remember the yoyo or you dont remember what color it was im sorry i i i dont remember the yoyo you didnt kill arthur delacroix yes i did but you just dont remember how im too old a cat to be fucked by a kitten thats my number you think of something that wasnt in the papers you give me a call i do remember one thing he had a starfish in his backpack a plastic starfish like a souvenir you know shit you got a smoke yeah here you go  thanks yep harry that story you giving him a ticket think its true shit i havent been in a blackandwhite in years nothing out of that shitbirds mouth is true including his name he confessed to what eight so far well never know how many others hes done you can profile these serial motherfuckers till kingdom come youre never gonna get inside their heads crazys crazy i dont disagree he knew about the starfish that i cant figure you asked waits for proof he gave it to you smoking gun man i dont buy it i dont know his angle but im not buying it he didnt kill that delacroix child okay but what if he did  synced and corrected by chamallow  ', ' dang hooked it dude sure doesnt look much like his head shot anymore thats what years of the bottle looks like mustve been some hardass years sure this isnt a waste of time you like driving balls  bucks hit him three swings youre on but you know what im saying waits confessed why you always got to look a gift horse in the mouth arthur delacroix endured prolonged abuse then goes missing father tells the daughter he reported it but doesnt that puts sam delacroix out there prime suspect unless somebody else confesses we always get false confessions waits is a psychopath howd he know about the starfish im just saying nice shot tiger i get to be tiger cause im black because youre good no cigar but youre pissing him off you think its so easy you try it i dont golf golf is a great sport golf is not a great sport if you can smoke and drink while youre doing it its not a sport well it might relax you lord knows you need it theres more to life than work get your wallet out harry thats what im talking about ooh now that we got his attention we gonna go talk to him or what no we go to palm springs talk to the mother get some background brace pops lets go

time to time  and and when officer pierce and irving junior pulled over this waits character apparently irving deliberately punched in the wrong plate number because he wanted to search the van guess he reversed a couple of numbers  an oldschool move i know did it myself a couple times back in the day but the thing is harry a case like this you do not want a hinky probable cause on the van search so tell pierce to keep his mouth shut yeah well thats where the rubber hits the fucking road my friend because apparently this pierce is some kind of eagle scout wants me to file a complaint  goes to paper it fucks the case yeah and me you ever go camping accidentally wipe your ass with poison oak okay so no but if i write junior up irvings the camper and im the poison oak not only that if i dont file then all of a sudden ive got a failuretotakeaction gripe coming at me from officer pierce its fucking department politics dont worry about it ill talk to pierce you will thanks harry i owe you

medical records wh when did okay he would have been  last august send him a card  excuse me oh right youd lost touch your daughter said he disappeared years ago i didnt know we believe he was murdered shortly after he disappeared oh god all these years no contact with your family no nothing at all about a year after i left i drove by the house one night to check on the children hoping to get a glimpse of them make sure they were okay but the drapes were drawn and i didnt stop well why not i was afraid of what my exhusband would do if he saw me when you filed for divorce you cited physical abuse sam beat me i ran away i thought that the children would be better off without me better off with an abusive alcoholic id like you to leave now both of you if theres anything further you can contact my attorney give us a moment jerry i want you to go too mrs waters you do want us to try and find your sons killer of course i i gave this to artie  where did you find it it was recovered from the gravesite do you remember where you bought it uh no i i probably picked it up somewhere a yard sale maybe mrs waters did you ever see your husband your your exhusband strike the children no i was his punching bag detective just me why do you think sam killed arthur we dont know who killed your son were still in the very early stages of our investigation what about funeral arrangements i mean i

truth  thank you for your time detective of course all these years ive had this daydream that my children were okay and doing well even thriving without me that id see them again some day and that

them so wed like for you to tell us exactly what happened that day to the best of your recollection okay uh ii had an audition in the afternoon a  thing quality drama uh i hadnt worked in well quite a while so i was stressed i had a little drink just a nip you know how it is round off the edges i had to get the kids off to school it wasnt easy arthur was wearing this black tshirt that he always wore the damn thing was filthy i made him change so i go to the audition the director said that i was the wrong type for the part he was just being polite i was half in the bag so then arthur came back from school what time was the audition what time did arthur get home you know what maybe i picked him up at school nah i cant remember like i said i was soused but you remember what shirt he was wearing its funny how that is i mean some things stick some things dont right yeah that is strange isnt it i guess i picked arthur up somewhere between school and home you happen to remember what street nah or or maybe it was at the school bus stop like i like i said ii was half in the bag but you did pick him up somewhere after school right um i saw arthur and uh i waved him into the car well thats when i saw that he still had that damn black tee on i yelled at him and he tried to get out of the car while it was still moving iii lost it iii just pfft lost it  i hit him you hit him how with your fist  yeah you do that a lot mr delacroix  what do what your son did you beat him a lot what no i didnt lose your temper beat him everyday when you were drinking yeah yeah i guess i must have it just went too far but you didnt mean to do it thats right hhe he must have hit his head on the car door and i i couldnt wake him up and ii panicked ii i drove around for a long time and just to make sure that he was you know and uh  i took him up into the canyon which one uh you know the one you said coldwater laurel beachwood uh i dont know it was one of those city side or valley side somewhere up there uh it was dark and i carried him up the hill i carried my boy up the hill and i buried him i buried my own son like an animal and youre sure he was dead when you carried him up the hill he was dead i couldnt wake him up and you carried him up the hill by yourself mr delacroix no one helped just me i did it i dont think he could have carried that kid up the hill he just killed his son his adrenalines pumping bigtime drunk and alone rough terrain i humped that hill sober with just a backpack and a flashlight and it smoked my bag and i damn near broke my neck on the way back down and arthur wasnt killed from hitting his head on a car door somebody hit him with a brick a stick or a bat we get a dummy the right size and weight im the same age sam was i climb up the hill and see if

the work address so i wanted to be a veterinarian  but now i think im gonna be a cop popped that zombie right between the eyes when they start showing up in la im gonna give you a call im being very serious harry i can tell you know mom says youre the best detective shes ever met  she said that mmhmm okay so ive been reading about you on the internet  yeahhuh the trial they found you guilty  not exactly it was a civil trial mmhmm they ruled against me sort of fined me a whole dollar  oh well thats not so bad nah is it true your mom was a prostitute she was a good person she did her best to take care of me and somebody killed her yeah they did i wish you could have met your grandmother you would have loved her she would have loved you harry yes maam when you go back to la can we skype skype is that like hulu jesus eleanor dont be sore what are you antigun now what if i were you didnt even bother to find out okay sorry next time ill ask look harry for maddies sake im all for you being in our lives but not if its harry the funloving dad and me the disapproving disciplinarian mom first time ive ever been accused of being funloving look at the waits stuff you knew i would and when i heard the name raynard waits i thought it was an alias theres this character in medieval french literature reynard the fox reynard means fox anyway hes sly and selfish and he uses his cunning to triumph over brute strength usually a dullwitted wolf puts me the dullwitted wolf youre a cop so you symbolize brute strength so he taunts and calls you because hes reveling in outwitting you convinced hes smarter than we are thats typical of psychopaths anyway in the stories he has a castle where he goes to hide a place where he waits so things he took from the hardware store the sump pump the lights these are all for his lair what about the mothballs when i was a kid my dad used to throw them under the house to get rid of the rats okay so basement or dungeon yeah now his familiarity with these folk tales is unusual for an american so hes probably french or has a french background or studied french in school look at this i was looking into the coroners report the other detectives characterize waits as homosexual but i dont think thats right preys on gay men prostitutes hustlers yeah but i dont think he sees himself as gay or at least hes deeply conflicted because look the two rapes that we know of they were postmortem and they were brutal which means he can only achieve an erection after the satisfaction of that rage any idea of the origin of that rage well murderers who exhibit this kind of behavior usually were sexually abused as children so my guess is he was raped as a boy and what started out as revenge has become a compulsion the hardware store

waits i agree cooperation is always preferable to conflict which is why ive refrained from releasing my copy of the video your copy ahh i think that video cuts both ways dont you waits escape while in lapd custody well it certainly shows you ordering detective bosch to loosen waits handcuffs and once the shooting starts the unsympathetic observer might conclude you were whats the word cowering

white west side as long as the video doesnt come out la is a threepiece suit black white and brown you need two out of three to get elected mayor in this town my endorsement would go a long way in the black community everyone knows ive been a fierce critic of the current chief where is he from originally boston philly its crucial the next chief be a native angeleno someone from within the

soundly this holiday season chief the apprehension of raynard waits remains our top priority and we are devoting every resource to achieving that task as expediently as possible but we as los angeles turned out good chief morning shows all carried it live i think we got the message out no more fingerpointing no more laying of blame all hands on deck till this is over yes sir that came through loud and clear now we just have to catch this little motherfucker before he brings us all down the one day of the year that i go in late to work am i interrupting well mm as a matter of fact we are wrapping presents christmas its tomorrow  it is mmhmm  hi harry hey leese one of those for me  yeah the fruitcake mm nice same one i gave you guys last year you want a cup of coffee so what is so important that it couldnt wait until i got into the office brasher gave  a preliminary statement said stokes grabbed her gun  all right isnt that what happened not what i saw oh shit harry dont tell me this stokes hands were on the wall fuck i mean i cant swear to it couldnt see clearly i think she tried to cuff him and her gun went off well its not great but shit happens that would be her third unsat oh shit so thats why shes got to put it on stokes looking to save her job except you wont corroborate not that im asking you to i mean either way shes done if she gives a false statement you think you can persuade her to do the right thing i can try what about stokes i should cut him loose at least wait until tomorrow fewer of brashers fellow officers around to see it go down also gives you more time to get brasher to change her story yeah and its a nice gesture with the holidays and all exactly cables included of course great thats great she loves her programs you know we have live entertainment on weekends and holidays and we offer nondenominational services on sundays well that that sounds nice and lovely um how much does all this cost depends on the plan what addons you

her bury her with them those fucking whores are you fucking kidding sorry forget i mentioned it oh youre sorry  whats on your agenda today well the usual and a sitdown with isaiah ott i thought you loathed the man i do and he me if theres one thing the right reverend isaiah ott desires more than any other in this world its his fat thumb on the carotid artery of the so why the sitdown were gonna come to an agreement the good reverend and i  a meeting of the minds about what  what can ott do for you its not what he can do for me  but what he can do for richard oshea rick oshea really new mayor new chief of police i see dont forget just because a man wears his collar turned round doesnt mean he can be trusted tell me something i dont know hows it going are you familiar with the term needle in a haystack  its there somewhere and what makes you so sure i spent last night looking at my maclaren file and found a pattern a recurring notation ac  ac  its a code they use when they put you in solitary itll help us find waits real name  they put kids in solitary for what infractions attitude disrespect that was you im betting oh i gave them a lot of lip ran away all the time too  other stuff other stuff like what fighting mostly i was mad  id kick your ass if you bumped me in the lunch line or talked shit about my mother so i spent a lot of time in the trunk so did waits if that notations not in the file put it aside harry its a fuckin youth home theres gonna be more files with the notation than without it  dont be negative its a start yeah what she said hilarious ignore that bullshit harry tech unit pinged waits phone rosedale cemetery waits mother passed thats why he called me have the task force send a unit over get any video ping his phone every minutes  yeah and maybe we get lucky maybe i win the lottery  you got to buy a ticket first is that how that works jesper says hes got something to show us on delacroix okay  hey how you doing jules like i got titpunched by a gorilla youre all right brasher  sarge hang on a second yeah brasher captain wants to see you asap yeah whats the prognosis doctor says i could be back on active duty in two to three weeks  and what do you say three weeks sounds like a long time i could use more like you but instead of having more im down one because your storys bullshit isnt it brasher  have you ready our statement i dont have access to the file sir it wouldnt matter if bosch had backed your story you think the forensics came back in your favor you think they found  on his hands  i dont know you do they didnt everything they found supports stokes version of what happened not yours maybe i should have my league rep here sir im trying to save your job but you have to meet me halfway how do i do that detective bosch initiated a sexual relationship with you against department policy you need to report that  relationship and file a complaint a complaint you felt pressured into the relationship because he was your superior coerced you thought it would hurt your career if you didnt comply well technically he wasnt my superior  and i didnt feel pressured it was an inappropriate relationship according to department policy was it not how does filing a harassment complaint undermine his statement about what happened in the garage it doesnt it makes it irrelevant no one downtown wants to see a sex scandal in the papers especially involving bosch file the complaint withdraw your false statement and command buries your third unsat like it never happened but he didnt coerce me it was mutual he fucked you brasher every which way bosch fucked you fucked you right out of your career with the  you gonna let that stand can i think about it dont take too long  meantime youre back on light duty thank you captain  chief irving reverend can i give you the Â¢ tour oh im familiar with this church i used to come here every sunday with my parents of course i forget youre from the community i dont  what can i do for you chief well actually i think theres something we can do for each other  im listening you could use your considerable charisma and your standing in the community to support richard osheas candidacy for mayor i thought you and he were mortal enemies alliances shift one has to be flexible in this world well assuming the quid pro quo is what i think it is what would i get in return from you and the new mayor for my support assuming you deliver what would you want in return reverend a halt to gestapo tactics here on the streets of south la to certain policing policies to racial profiling we are hardly the gestapo and overheated hateful rhetoric doesnt help my apologies i only mean to say that it is in both our interests to avoid anything resembling a ferguson missouri situation here in la  the last thing any of us want so we understand each other it appears so jesper whats so important you couldnt just  send over a report i wanted to show you something i was doing a final log on the delacroix evidence the backpack had skateboard straps right there was no skateboard found at the grave site but there was one collected from nicholas trents house we dismissed trent as a suspect no evidence connects him to arthur and he moved to that neighborhood two years after the kid was killed i was just looking to see if we missed anything before i sent it all to the property division so just to be thorough i thought id check to see if polyfibers from the backpack straps mightve got caught in the wheel assemblies i didnt find any fiber but i found this this kind of board was fancy back in the day most kids wouldve put their mark on it  ad  arthur delacroix god damn  the year before he died  nicholas trent had the kids board good work jesper  we need photos of all this will do  uh detective bosch yeah ill be right out  i think i fucked up on the waits case how so i got a call here in the lab right after waits was arrested guy said he was from the das office sounded totally legit he said you guys hadnt turned in an evidence report yet and he needed to know what was found at the grave site he couldnt get a hold of you and he was up against a deadline  jesus christ im really sorry  he sounded so fucking real you told waits about the backpack what was inside told him about the starfish that was his get out of jail free card you have any idea what you did i do and i shouldve known better do you want me to resign  what did he want to confess confess to what waits got ahold of a burner at pitchess called jesper  conned him out of the starfish stupid fuck  you kicked his ass didnt have to well bright side at least he solved the laurel canyon case for us  how you figure clear as day trent had the board he took it from arthur after he killed him come on open your eyes partner we were right about trent before we were wrong he lived with it all those years waited for that knock on the door one day it came we knocked on his door and he killed himself then go ahead and write it up  damn youre back i start tomorrow  what did pounds want boschs head on a stick sounds proper said the only way i can stay on the force is to file a sexualharassment complaint after what he did to you do it he screwed you brasher and betrayed all of us now you want to be a cop you got to lay him out one way or another his story stands youre done anyway  pyrrhic victory what well even if it works mess up my career as much as his  how do you figure blows back on me my reputation ill be stuck on patrol forever i like the street but i know college girl like you a climber  you got bigger ambitions yeah much bigger jerry anything new on waits task force says a camera in hollywood caught a minivan last night that matches the one were looking for  get the plates no plates bad angle  shit yeah where you going harry  julia can we talk are you fucking kidding me  youre in uniform very observant youre not a detective for nothing yeah harry im back pending the outcome of the disciplinary process im sure youre just chomping  at the bit over that you should go home  excuse me take leave until this is over  why the hell should i do that because its the honorable thing to do if you dont have the balls to man up admit your mistake tell the truth at least have the decency to not be here fronting your phony story who the fuck are

la oh were committed now you want to get on the wrong side of this guy you want him working for the incumbent i sure as hell dont you started the ball rolling irv  where the hell did you expect it to go oh i wont forget this well get even later this is a big galloping gift horse coming down the stretch for both of us lets back a winner lets get started mr trent you know you have no obligation to speak to me today well if thats so then why are you sitting in my living room have you ever seen any unusual activity on the hillside not really kids used to play up there  you watched them play what are you insinuating  nothing at all sir no i didnt watch them play i stayed away from kids after my trouble id see them go up the hill when i walked my dog any kids in particular there were always kids around uh they used to go up there and smoke cigarettes we we were always worried that they would set the whole hillside on fire  we the residents my neighbors and i  drguyot detective bosch what brings you back here detective are you making progress fits and starts doctor fits and starts so nicholas trent told us that when he first moved here there were always kids playing on the street and up on the hill yes quieter now not so many children on the street these days  you remember any names of those kids  years ago i was not a young man even then you think your murdered boy mightve been one of them possibly once in a while maybe he had friends on this street  have you spoken to the blaylocks i dont recognize that name from the neighborhood canvass we did they moved to tonopah a few years back when he retired they lived down the block where the hutters live now my guess would be that most of the children who played on the street over the years were their foster children and their friends any chance you have an address for the blaylocks i get a christmas card from them every year without fail let me get one  ill be right back thanks i talked to the hutters and i called mrs blaylock in tonopah to follow up she didnt remember arthur and had nothing but kind words for nicholas trent did you get the names of the foster children she didnt mention she had any kids foster or otherwise youre making it seem like i dropped the ball what what was i supposed to do drive up there and knock on their door tonopah is a sixhour drive ill call you back jerry  mr blaylock thats me i uh saw you waiting out there my names harry bosch im a detective  i was wondering if i could speak to you and your wife about a case im working well im not sure my wifes up right now  how long you

who lived there in  well we lived there back then but i dont remember any murder cases from the neighborhood  a detective already called us about this really when it was before christmas you were out hiking  well you didnt tell me wasnt worth telling my partner called im just following up  i dont believe you excuse me you dont drive through the night to knock on our door at dawn because youre following up on a call youre gonna try to pin something on one of our kids mrs blaylock i can assure you im not in the business of pinning anything on anyone well i still dont believe you i know what he wants audrey please just let the man ask his questions i understand you took in a number of foster children when you lived on wonderland yes we did we had a total of  what kids over the years  sometimes as many as at a time good for you last month a boys bones were found up on the hill above wonderland he was murdered and buried there years ago his name was arthur delacroix does that name mean anything to either of you no audrey no and i told that to the detective that called i told him we didnt know anything about this dead boy well i was just wondering if it mightve been possible he couldve been friends with one of your kids this is what i mean youre just looking for something that fits your needs these kids come from tough backgrounds they werent all angels when they came to us now youre gonna pick one of them to blame this murder on id like you both to take a look at this photo it was taken in your carport on wonderland avenue i think i took this picture i gave copies to the kids do you recognize anyone in that photo well thats johnny and uh these are his friends from his old neighborhood  johnny johnny stokes he was with us for a couple of years uh thats his photograph there on the wall and you say these kids in the picture they were friends of johnnys from his old neighborhood we encouraged johnny to keep in touch with them have them over we used to have an empty pool in the backyard it was too much upkeep they used to love to use it to skate in this boy do you remember him uh yeah the the face i dont know his real name uh they called him goof goofy  you know why he would put the wrong foot forward on the skateboard and the kids called that goofy footing  that boy was arthur delacroix the murdered boy oh my im so sorry  do you recognize this huh audrey doesnt that look like the board johnny had maybe  any idea how he came by it it was so long ago he won it in a contest he was very proud of that board it got left behind when they sent him to sylmar do you know what happened to it when we moved out here we sold all the kids stuff we had to a neighbor who lived up the street remember a name the neighbor nick nick trent he worked in movies you know props and stuff it was stokes we had him i let him go where are you what are you talking about  i just left tonopah tonopah johnny stokes was one of the blaylocks foster kids  youre shitting

was his end game he wanted me to be part of it you said that he talked about what you had in common yeah he kept harping on it said we were dogs from the same kennel but that didnt mean that we were alike he fed a different dog a different dog thats what they told us at mcclaren everyone has two dogs fighting inside of them one does the right thing one doesnt the one you choose to feed in the end is the one who wins the fight i fed the right one he didnt how do you feel about killing him i did what i had to do needed to be done and when you found out he pointed an unloaded gun at you look doc waits committed suicide by cop he knew it was over he wanted me to kill him he wanted me to see what hed done he wanted me to carry all of it you know what he got what he wanted  us and them sync and

the one they kept on you when you were in that place when you were a kid yeah i thought you mightve i saw your picture and it got me curious said they took you away from your mother and put you there and that you did a lot of bad things to people and got into fights its true im not proud of some of the things i did when i was there it said you were always trying to escape but when your mother was killed you stopped there was no place to escape to im really really sorry you had to go through that dad the white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only no parking sorry mom i didnt mean to worry you well discuss it later but dont ever scare us like that again okay we have a quick turnaround we got to go right back through security okay dad i had a really fun time with you me too daughter safe travels see you inside thanks harry for what shes our daughter yeah bosch detective its ida in deputy chief irvings office hi ida how are you the chief wants you in his office in minutes will that be a problem no no problem could you give me a heads up what its about thank you detective well see you then good morning detective morning ida should be just a minute hes finishing up a meeting thank you you can go in now detective chief detective bosch i wanted you to know that the district attorneys impaneling a grand jury to hear evidence on the waits case you can expect to be subpoenaed i thought you stepped on it you have the video i did and i do but this is bureau politics bosch above your pay grade as you say this grand jury is oshaes way of enforcing our um understanding anyway i wanted you to be prepared i also understand that you arrested john stokes for arthur delacroixs murder im on my way to the das office to file charges after were done here good if hes charged it wont be a problem problem a man charged with murder has credibility issues whatever he might say about the incident involving officer brasher will be discounted youre not firing brasher shes reinstated shell be transferred to pacific division where she can get a fresh start and as a condition of that reinstatement officer brasher has agreed not to file a complaint of any kind against you complaint for what it would be quite damaging to the department if the detective who killed raynard waits and saved the hostage was mired in a sexual harassment complaint there it is alls well that ends well and all for the good of the department you can go now bosch and as you do it might be wise for you to consider how things couldve gone and might still go if you choose to put yourself ahead of the department i said you can go harry jesus can we talk theres nothing to talk about you won you saved your job  the fix is in so thats it im late for something what do you want i thought that since irving settled everything today that you know maybe you and i can do the same  settle things in what way julia look our paths are gonna cross again are we gonna be all right all right and then we just forget everything that happened in the garage all right that you used me to make a deal with irving to save your job that wasnt my idea it was his i was never gonna file a complaint against you right look what do you want me to say that i was wrong that i panicked because i didnt want to lose my job you want me to quit cause im not gonna do that harry im a good cop and it was stokes who turned out to be a bad guy theres us and theres them you know that irving knows that thats why he made the right call today so why cant we just get past this i guess because im just on the wrong side of that us and them equation  you dont have to be no i need to be goodbye julia so what happened you dont want to know lets go you have him in custody right  hold thats about all hell ever do for this what why this homicide was committed in  when your suspect was years old at that time the law did not allow a  to be charged as an adult  laws been changed youre right they changed them in but that doesnt help us were governed hereby what the laws were at the time the crime was committed so what are our options we have none juvenile penalties end at age  this man is  were not going through the time and expense of taking him to trial just to see him walk out the door in the end this shit bird kills a kid gets a walk im sorry detective thats the law nothing i can do about it well look at it this way harry you cleared the case and gosh he did what almost hours for that homicide  where are you going just gonna have a word with him harry do not make a bad situation

hidden camera of his own so so we have video of one of your vehicles leaving the scene how do you think we found you we have warrants not cameras audio surveillance legal wire hooray we want the tapes from his office from his car his phones his house wherever youre up on him and why thats confidential you got to have a need to know and a right to know and you dont have either this is a homicide investigation we have both mr allen was a peripheral figure in an ongoing operation thats a matter of national security you talking about terrorism and we are satisfied that his murder was unrelated to the larger inquiry id like to know how you know that why youd go to the trouble of bugging him if he was so damn peripheral were not having this conversation oh yeah we are somehow you people knew about this murder and you sat on it we made the appropriate phone calls its not our fault it took you two days to follow up on it you have a bug in his car is that how you knew got his fucking murder on tape its been almost years since  now were working our asses off to make sure the next  doesnt happen for another years so were not about to compromise our entire operation to help you solve a

we need a fresh take we now mr district attorney speculation is rampant that youre running for mayor gail its no secret that ive been thinking about it but i have not made up my mind yet when do you anticipate doing that now thats some pure deep bullshit i love my job chief ms kowski from the mayors office on line  did she say what it was about no sir all right deputy chief irving chief its jen kowski bosch detective ah i thought i was going to get your voice mail again this is keisha russell  from the times how can i help you i write the times murder blog im familiar with it then you know we cover every murder that occurs in los angeles in fact i just wrote about your latest case nothing new to comment on at this time following all leads et cetera et cetera well thats not why im calling  then why as you probably know we keep a running tally of unsolved cases so i get tips about open cases some legit some crazy i can imagine twice now in the last four months a womans called me to say she knows details about an unsolved murder from years ago yes the murder of marjorie lowe detective bosch keisha its keisha right  right keisha dont you think this woman read the articles that came out during my trial and just looking for some attention of course thats possible why did she call you and not me she did she said she left you a message and you never called her back so she called me ive been on leave for six months i didnt get the message she identify herself i only have her first name annette and i have a phone number the thing is keisha ive been over that murder book a hundred times i could recite it to you verbatim theres no one named annette in it on any page so im thinking this woman whoever she is doesnt know anything i dont already know maybe she wasnt in the murder book maybe they missed her the first time around thats possible isnt it yeah its possible but i doubt it okay well clearly youre not interested so im sorry to bother you detective okay just give me the number  detective keisha russell from the times said some womans been calling her with information about my mothers murder legit i doubt it ill deal with it later  where are you going autopsy id ask you to come but i know youre busy yeah im so busy see you tomorrow dont forget your shirts you got to start dressing better man look sharp feel sharp you feel me yeah i feel you so the bear says to the guy you dont really come up here to hunt do you okay heres my question do you not remember how many times youve told me that joke or you do remember but you think that i dont does it have to be one or the other  uh crate barrel just the guys im looking for  hey whats up anthony allen im working up his property taxes credit cards came across a civil filing when he turned he changed his name from avakian arman avakian armenian where did he grow up  here or the old country east hollywood ah little armenia our old stomping grounds you guys worked the gang unit right indeed we did he got a record yeah convicted of assault at  bar brawl some latino gang did a year in county banger armenian pride mmhmm ap was just a typical street gang back then  now oh a highly organized serious criminal enterprise with ties to the russians other exsoviet mafias the bratva the brotherhood you could see why he might want to change his name and leave his youthful indiscretions behind yeah become a legit pornographer and all you remember this kid uh yeah we cant remember what we had for lunch today theres a guy you could talk to at glendale  um  uh well put him in touch yeah if we can remember his name thanks where was i  uh oh oh  a guy goes hunting oh yeah two expended projectiles caliber you see the muzzle impression the powder burn and the stippling pattern double job close contact those look rough from a ballistics point of view the one is worthless mushroomed and fragmented on impact but the other half the shafts still intact could be matched one other thing deep bruise on his right cheek antemortem definitely so not from being shoved in the trunk he was alive when he sustained it like this yep just like that detective edgar howd you know the status on the allen computer is exactly where it was three hours ago were still imaging everything on his hard drive fingerprinting its very good you actually paid attention in the training class so the thumb drives working out for you oh just the best thing ever detective i have a rush on this yeah thanks for that by the way i wanted to be here all night instead of going home to my juicy and enthusiastic girlfriend well this should speed things up whats this an addendum to the search warrant narrows the hard drive search to business and banking records anything pertaining to  productions anything associated with the names anthony allen veronica allen jessica gilroy or arman avakian well that narrows it down but ill be here all night rooting you on booyah ill call you when i find something of relevance till then find some place else to root roger that and yet you stand there breathing down my neck did i mention shes a gymnast im living the dream oh he insisted that i do it the cats cagey

seat get you anything coffee water im fine thanks thank you for coming irv i know youre a busy man i cant be any busier than you mr mayor since were both so busy ill cut right to it theres an election on the horizon you may have heard i would like your endorsement it would mean a lot to me it would mean a lot to this city to have you on our team im flattered but ive always thought police should stay out of politics above the fray so why are you about to endorse rick oshea the thing about secrets in this town is they have a short shelf life hes asked im considering it you and reverend ott this sunday at greater page temple im assuming hes made you some promises vis a vis the department more funding pie in the sky chief of police nothings set in stone im glad to hear that the west side mad at you the novelty has worn off whered you come up west adams whered you come up highland park oh then youre familiar with the avenues the street gang sure theyve been in highland park for generations back in the day the avenues had standing orders from la eme to kill any black person who came into highland park on sight ive heard the stories i assumed they were apocryphal oh far from it then imagine what we could do together to mend our histories to bring black and brown together i have more in common with you irv as a native angeleno than i do with an immigrant from honduras or a gangbanger from el salvador and my spanish isnt that hot either mejor que lo mio seguro que tu mama no es chicana ill ask her and tenzer hes had a good run he cant be chief of police forever will you think it over irv i will think it over hector in fact ill pray on it thank you been mining his computer all night tip of the iceberg but enough to know allen was washing big bucks through his production company the skin flicks on the books budgets of under half a mil production distribution marketing they couldnt cost more than fifty seventy k apiece to make its a ten to one ratio whats the exact mechanism big checks to dummy corporations and vendors for investment costs the films come out more big checks to investors phony income from  and online streaming ninety cents on the dollar feds mustve known what he was up to bigger fish to fry anything from the phone records lotta calls to and from a strip club in vegas called dollys including the last one he ever got hmm girlfriend or just business this was in his wallet oh pretty girlfriend  im betting his wife said he had a new one  any names yet not yet well girlfriend in vegas lets assume allen was bringing that cash back from vegas i am thinking you need to go to vegas  start with allens hotel i was just gonna suggest that plus you can check in on your wife and kid  make sure that you do roger that viva las vegas what about me you have to stay here and finish the financials what you get for being so tech savvy harry in vegas what a waste i could be all up in the champagne room at the spearmint making it rain for

this audio surveillance from anthony allens office his office phone his cell phone and his car what about his house said they werent up on the house excluded from the warrant meaning if they had it they wouldnt give it to us im assured this is the pertinent material  was it hard to get suspiciously easy  its been redacted no doubt whatd you have to give them full report on what we know so far whatd they say about the cash in his car didnt blink said they were aware of his possible criminal activities they shed any light on those activities only to reiterate that they were unconnected to their larger investigation but please keep them in the loop which i promised to do and in return they promise to keep us in the dark and feed us shit with the feds it does tend to be a oneway street any idea what theyre up to a matter of national security right thanks for going to bat on this bosch try to stay clear of whatever this is  above both our pay grades do my best harry carl here to see mrs allen is she home yeah hows it going you know one step at a time its a grind i remember your partner was here yesterday looking at footage yeah he said it was exciting watching the  guy come and

the guy whos gonna tell you how this thing plays out lets hear it mr rykoffs been undercover with the marks organization a trusted asset and a vital liaison between marks and his russian associates the russians bring dope and women into the us through cartel border tunnels send cash and guns south they do business with the cartels and the cartels do business with the terrorists and any day now these tunnels will be used to move explosives and terrorists into this country  and al qaeda here on american soil  you get the picture yeah yeah i get the picture why didnt you tell me who you were what the deal was i was undercover you found a gun in my house that i didnt put there i dont break cover for dirty cops  you callin me dirty prove youre not fuck you rykoff and what is your real name

marks gets a hint that weve infiltrated his organization he will shut everything down and cauterize the problem hes done it before  so what do we do nothing at the arraignment rykoffs attorney will alert the judge to a fault in the search warrant the judgell toss the gun hell dismiss the charges rykoff will be released what about us we have a homicide investigation here right you go about your

evidence on arceneauxs criminal activities and he had just met a group of his accomplices and participated in an armed robbery of a drop house in highland park how many cops we talkin about so far a handful investigations still in its early stages names hed identified a female officer maureen ogrady we have descriptions nicknames and audio tapes on the others all males when we know who they are youll know with george irving gone im not gonna lie were hurting we were a long way from going to the da before this happened im not sure where we are all right  so the situation here we dont know if its armed robbery some gang banger officer irving in the wrong place at the wrong time or an assassination by one of these dirty cops what are the chances they found out officer irving was working for  officer irving did not believe that he was under suspicion how involved does  expect to be its s investigation but george irving was our guy we will assist you in any way we can all right so what do we do whats our first move do we bring em in i say we wait and watch if they didnt know that officer irving was undercover i absolutely want to keep it that way okay then  will put ogrady and arceneaux under surveillance i want to talk to him to arceneaux officer irving was my son uh chief maybe you and i should step outside i think he knows who killed george  you know the rules you cant

room follow me so whats goin on dont get your hopes up could just be a hunch undercover  agent in the marks organization disappeared two years ago christmas eve they assume marks had him killed buried in the desert but theyve no idea where okay we also found traces of old blood in the trunk of allens car  the agents maybe theyre working the  but today we got the  data from that car going back almost three years you think the  indicates where the bodys buried mm thats my hunch tony allen was just a money launderer i dont see him as the hitter maybe just the clean up guy marks cousin someone he could trust to get rid of a dead body mr wolf who harvey keitel pulp fiction the clean up guy you know i dont go to the movies  at least you know it is a movie thats something of course i know its a movie anyway tell griffin about the blood in the car give him the  data let the feds figure it out even if it doesnt pan out youve made the effort could be helpful hope so you hope so what that the

to talk to you omni hotel suite  im about to have dinner with my daughter i can meet up with you afterwards of course have a nice dinner thank you sir you have to go to work not before we eat irving its open my son was working undercover for internal affairs special operations division i had no idea no one did he was part of a team putting together a case against a crew of corrupt vice and narcotics officers theyd been ripping off drug dealers shaking down merchants and all of this at the moment the  investigation into my sons death is focused on possible gang retaliation or that george did stumble into an armed robbery and his death had nothing to do with his undercover work those both seem plausible no he was found out and they murdered him sir i know one of the leads brad coniff hes as good as it comes at his job im sure he is when hes allowed to do it but its campaign season bosch dirty cops killing a fellow officer are you saying theyd cover this up the mayor and his police chief theyll do whatever they can to impede this investigation until after the election and then theyll make sure it goes away quietly theyll cut deals with the guilty ones no trials no headlines no blow back and no way to ever find out the truth well then as much as it might make them uncomfortable theres no way theyre gonna gut s investigation i would in their position done worse chief why am i here i want you to work the case with  with me i need you bosch i need a detective who will be relentless on behalf of my son  look sir arceneaux and right now hes untouchable and he knows whos behind

between us for now roger that im gonna take a look around mmhm he sent a text thanks drake maury shoot that bag it and get it to me coniff  a text was sent to george irvings cell sorry partner i let you down so five minutes before he bought the farm he texted an apology to his dead partner  and then he shot himself apparently you have your doubts detective to me that sells it as suicide if this is his phone and he actually sent the message why wouldnt it be keeping an open mind sir this is a burner after all and theres only one message on it he was dirty of course he had a burner his personal cell phone is missing he got rid of it any number of reasons or somebody took it all right what else have we got surveillance heard the gunshot at am contact attempted no response  called to make an entry arrived on the scene at  entry was made minutes later if somebody else was in the house when he died they had time to go out the backdoor past our team in the alley theyd gone to find a head oh if they had eyes on our surveillance they would have known when to pull the trigger you know sometimes things are just as they seem detectives and this to me is one of those times im looking forward to reading your report did you hear what i just heard  what did you hear that he wants this to be a suicide needs it even yeah well fuck him im not shading my report for anybody not even the chief of ds  bosch something come up  minutes  dad dad i got a feelin that i cant let go  i got a feelin that i cant let go  i got a feelin that i cant let go  i got a feelin that i cant let go  i got a feelin that i cant let go  got a feelin that i cant let go  i got a feelin that i cant let go  cant let go i feel  its him autopsy will confirm but its him its burrell yeah im sure st judes medal in his pocket wifes initials on the back she gave it to him when he took this assignment i told her i didnt tell her hed been tortured all the bones in his hands and feet for silver that text is as good as a signed suicide note suicide solves a lot of problems on the tenth floor two dead cops friends one a hero one a criminal overcome with remorse theyll call it a suicide but we both know its not that works for nash too he went to the trouble suicide buys him time  for what the big payday pot of gold that connects all of this allens murder to your sons and nash to both take a look at these photos nash took tony allen was leaving his wife for her the younger woman he was gonna marry her he was gonna take his money with him now veronica needs a partner to stop that from happening nash so hes waiting to get paid for killing her husband  and youre sure theres a pot of gold im betting on it  so how do we find it weve been watching the widow shes been waiting too waiting for the estate to settle shell lead us to the money thatll lead us to nash follow the money follow the fuckin money bosch you know coniff and espinosa yeah brad and i go back the  task force on george irvings murder is now investigating the death of eddie arceneaux you guys callin it a suicide or a murder were calling it undetermined at this time two nights ago you gave me carl nashs name as a lead in the irving killing check him out working on it nash left  under a cloud at least thats the story the storys true whatd he do corrupt brutal ton of his cases were tainted big ugly can of worms nobody wanted opened so  bounced him on some bullshit technicality who told you nash sold guns to arceneaux confidential informant any chance that informant was eddie arceneaux arceneaux wasnt one of my cls you know there are informants who cooperate voluntarily and then there are those who are forced to found that in his trashcan  it was used on someone so what hes a cop arceneaux had marks on his wrist consistent with that cuff youre suggesting i forced arceneaux to give me nashs name all right thats outrageous did you piss off detectives wheres this going bosch and edgar have got a case to work weve got a case to work too were investigating the murder of a brave young undercover officer not some mobbed up piece of shit pornographer so if you have information we should have nows the time im drawing up a warrant today for nashs house when were good to go well give you a call maybe we find something helps us both out all we wanted a little cooperation you got it you two arent going anywhere how did you connect nash to arceneaux and their case our sources at van nuys said nash was the guy in the valley to see for a throw away i passed it along and you didnt tell me because not our case s hands off is there anything else youre not telling me not that i can think of we could use some extra hands to help surveille veronica allen i can give you two shifts johnson and moore ferris and roberts beautiful  bosch yeah lets get a cup of coffee harry i know youre off the reservation what i dont know is if youve got company not sure i follow you lieutenant i know its not edgar

hes grieving angry your point  people get desperate they get dangerous they do damage to themselves and others thanks for the warning bosch sorry i kept you waiting thanks for meeting me on such short notice on a saturday not a problem we found him right where you thought he would be im so sorry cant even imagine what that familys been going through the last two years the director asked me to convey his thanks i appreciate that he authorized the amendment to your record your flag will be removed any idea how long that will take you know bureaucracies all too well in the interim i have a letter of recommendation signed by the director that ought to open a few doors thank you i wish i could do more visÃ vis the bureau itself no no i understand a fresh start yeah a fresh start whats good on this roach coach tacos al pastor i dont even know what the hell that is but ive had my shots excuse me can i uh please have uno mas taco al pastor por favor burrell was a good guy didnt deserve to end up in a hole in the middle of the desert you tie marks to his murder sure as hell gonna try if the blood in tonys trunk is burrells theyll file  charges against marks and his top guy see if they get one of them to flip you wont have to testify i told you man i like bein lucky luke rykoff it suits me  so look i just wanted to come by and thank you in person i dont know what youre talkin about i dont believe you i hope it all works out you know for your ex still dont know what youre talkin about  youre a shitty liar that mean you dont believe i planted that gun no were officially cool you and me thats good to hear what about that tail youve had on me the last three weeks you knew about that shit uhhuh well fuck you we pulled it off you this morning you really want to do something for me rykoff it depends we think we know who planted the gun in your bathroom now im interested an ex  homicide detective who orchestrated the hit on tony allen wanted it to look like it came from joey marks so he framed me fuck that guy why money love maybe both we think hes involved with veronica allen tonys widow cooked it up together thats the working theory you know anything well i dont know anything about the love angle but i can help you with the money bosch so tony was skimming the skim joey expected him to steal a certain amount within reason cant trust a guy whos too honest he might be an undercover cop  but suddenly two years ago tony starts stealing more yeah lots more hand over fist how do you know about two years ago thats when he met layla layla well there you go theres your love connection right there man see joey asked me to go back over dollys books which i do and i come up with this number and i multiply that number times the other clubs in his rackets and you know i get a pretty good guesstimate how much three and a half four million bucks no shit in just two years yeah but you gotta understand tony was washing all of joeys cash from the clubs the girls credit cards drugs like all of it thats a lot of skim to skim what did marks do ugh he drove to la and accused tony to his face of ripping him off which of course tony denied which is when nash and veronica figured the frame they overheard the fight its a smart play right tony gets whacked everyone assumes its joey that puts him down and then you show up at my place and you pull that gun out of my toilet im thinkin fuck this guys on joeys payroll hes gonna frame me to take the fall yeah but what about all the cash they ever recover it as far as i know its still out there hey i gotta go they do not like me hanging out in public with suspicious looking characters hey luke luke goshen good to meet you luke goshen so whats next for you theyll find a spot for me besides now i

morning as ive said until i am blue in the face i dont know did you doublecross him or did he doublecross you i knew the man to say hello to at the front gate was it your idea or his idea was what his idea or mine  to kill your husband detective i had nothing to do with my husbands death when you looked in that empty safe deposit box it must have been a shock i went there to collect what was mine legally what did you expect to find documents papers photographs i had no idea what tony had in there cash youre busy concocting a fantasy detective it never happened what a grim workplace you inhabit does it ever get you down i kind of like it it inspires me i bet it does suits you if you think this is grim imagine what prison is like if carl nash killed my husband he deserves to rot in one for the rest of his life where do you think layla is dont know dont care sure you do shes got the money right your money you and your stories detective she got to that safe deposit box the day after your husbands body was found the box was in her name too she didnt have to wait for probate what do you thinks in that backpack im betting its not the allen family photos layla outsmarted you and nash both have a nice chat shes had two days to get her story straight while edgar and i jump through hoops on the bank where are we on allens other five accounts frozen i called the  told them there were laundered funds in those accounts she cant touch them so speaking of the merry widow cant go to the  with what weve got as of now she walks wheres your car lets take this one mrs allen im martin weiss

case you know the tony allen murder you had eyes on our suspect since you questioned her mrs allen no we dont have the manpower tips are coming in fast and furious were checking out leads from here to tucson she give you anything i didnt lay a glove on her we want you to keep working the allen murder but nash is now the priority whats the current thinking on his whereabouts he dropped his hostage off at the edge of angeles forest on highway  took her a couple of hours to get to a phone she said he was headed north on  toward lancaster and palmdale which is ground zero at the moment excop knows the moves he would have ditched the car by now right that was our assumption too were waiting for it to turn up he might have been too injured to stop to switch cars it was a serious gunshot wound he was dragging that leg maybe he hasnt gotten that far maybe hes holed up somewhere closer in okay so what do you want us to do follow the guns from the shootout we collected six weapons from the scene nashs crew had no serial numbers on their weapons firearms has them now itll take them a couple of days theyll call you when theyre ready for you to follow up okay no problem what else the s negotiating a deal with ogrady pushing it through exigent circumstances with nash at large we could use one of you at the first interview ask about the allen case let us know keep us in the loop for real this time the guy can be anywhere  ohh ohh god damn it ohh come on uhh uhh ohh it sucks we dont have eyes on her harry ive got an idea for keeping tabs on veronica write a warrant for her

coverage you said she could give us nash on a platter legally we never said she knew his current whereabouts i have a signed agreement with the  do you have more questions riley piccininni arceneaux all dead that was the crew he kept it tight who shot tony allen riley how do you know i was there i flagged him on his way home so he stopped to help you right lets get back to george irving nash had big plans for him till we found out he was an  rat who shot him riley probably i dont know for sure what do you know about arceneauxs suicide wasnt how do you know i was there who actually pulled the trigger riley all three murders thats convenient he was nashs boy did his wet work what about veronica allen  that bitch where does she fit in carl was playing her in what way he was boning her said

passed away recently  my condolences mm as executor of his estate im authorized to assemble his finances of course i found that receipt in his desk how can i help you mrs allen a year ago you sold my husband  million of bearer bonds thats correct a legal transaction oh im sure the bonds are missing im trying to locate them im sorry to hear that its almost impossible to recover bearer bonds if theyre lost or stolen hmm i know that i also know that bearer bonds are used for money laundering tax evasion and other illicit business transactions youre very well informed hmm my husband was a money launderer he told me he was a producer of adult entertainment please lets cut the crap mr morada you knew the real source of my husbands income you helped him wash it that would be very hard to prove what you couldnt have known was that some of that money that you and my husband laundered tony stole from his cousin joey marks now obviously the armenians dont know you were involved in that or we wouldnt be sitting here well you certainly wouldnt i appreciate your discretion but they will if you dont help me find my fucking money rykoff estimated tony allen skimmed upwards of million  also jer yeah an hour ago veronica allen visited a bond trader downtown shes on her way home now so they still issue these these bearer bonds no but theres still some floating around hmm all right were checking out first thing in the morning we need to get that second tracker on her other car lets go make nice with mrs allen i was awfully hard on her yesterday and i feel just plain sick about it community relations im all in detective my lawyer told you to stay away from me i came to apologize i didnt think your lawyer would mind then come in and have a drink im on duty come in while i have a drink sure i cant entice you no no thank you well you were saying weve changed our assessment of the case the surviving officers cooperating shes given a statement she has according to her nash planned your husbands murder and she and his accomplices carried it out carl nash is now the sole focus of our investigation but i wanted to apologize on behalf of the department for suggesting you were involved in any way well you dont know how much i appreciate that and id appreciate it if you kept our conversation confidential when we catch nash well need you to testify testify to what detective hmm thatll depend on his defense im sure hell try to cut a deal to stay off death row and implicate as many other people as he can hmm youll have to catch him first oh we will he was seriously wounded in the shootout most likely hes holed up somewhere weak as a kitten well scoop him up and hell start talking hmm well lets hope that happens were counting on it anyway have a nice evening ill see myself out hes up to something of course he is men only say theyre sorry when they want something let me take you to dinner i know what you want can you blame me no if i were you id want me too i wont be a minute carl you got to have a lot of upper body strength to hand line big heavy bastard like the tuna you got to go arm over arm pitch and pull pitch and pull none of this rod and reel sit back and crank shit the old man and the sea thats me when was the last time you were there otter banks ten years ago maybe yet shit my brother was still alive you know what i love about the ocean i love how it doesnt give a flying fuck about you mm i get that itll swallow you up its big youre small deal with it how you feeling better antibiotics are kicking in i think you sure you dont want to know my side of the story how i got this thing would you tell me the truth mm well i could tell you but then id have to kill you i hope that was a joke oh of course it was hey like i said just keep me in the dark okay bosch we put tracking devices on both their vehicles may yield something and nash  have any idea hes off the radar gone to ground somewhere what do they have you doing were on hold waiting for firearms to finish processing the weapons from the scene follow the guns huh yeah thats a shit job yep theyre mad at you maybe i think connor suspects we were running a parallel investigation maybe he blames us for spooking nash setting this whole thing in motion it has crossed my mind yeah mine too we were so close to grabbing him up so what do you think happened why did nash spook i think somehow he knew wed been there to his house saw those photographs so have we heard anything yet i didnt want to spoil a lovely evening mm delicious what ahem through her family in yerevan we uh reached an aunt in toronto do they know where the little bitch is she does not but she heard from layla a few months ago about the wedding  wedding we were still married he didnt even have the balls to serve me with the divorce papers wedding fuck a wedding did they save the date still in the planning stages hmm to a nice armenian gangster twice her age lucky girl the aunt said traditional armenian wedding which would mean a church you know how many armenian churches there are in la our lady queen of martyrs tony never went to church a fucking day in his life well apparently layla was very attached to this particular church went on and on to the aunt about how the priest made her feel like family made her feel welcome made her feel at home hmm detectives agent griffin the floor is yours luke rykoff gave you some information pertaining to your allen case i assume it proved useful jurys still out were hoping the  will return the favor uh how the death of joey marks provides us with an opportunity now we have a legitimate shot at reinserting rykoff into the marks organization now the three of you know that rykoff is an  agent anyone else i dont think so okay we need for you to keep it that way so there can be no records into his true status or identity no conversation we need to maintain his legend okay consider it done thank you ill let you get back to it before you go martin weiss what about him we ran a plate on a car parked at veronica allens home last night it belonged to weiss id like to know where he stands in the broader scheme of your investigation up to his chin in shit but for your case fair game have a good day veronica allen and weiss think shes cutting him in on the money she may have no choice shes got to find it first do the assistant chiefs know as of an hour ago well be holding a press conference today to announce his resignation wed like you to be there id rather not it would look like im gloating everyone knows our history i want to balance the negative with the positive announce an interim chief at the same time what about assistant chief lopez hes come up through the ranks and its time for a hispanic chief of police be an historic moment for la im a latino mayor i cant appoint a latino chief who then you are you trying to coop me mr mayor wont work im still endorsing your opponent endorse who you like actually that will make the mayor look good above the partisan fray two conditions name them  has a free hand in their investigation into my sons death and departmental corruption no interference from you or anyone else let the chips fall where they may full transparency you have my word whats your other condition i will not be a candidate for the permanent position and youll announce that today we expected youd want to be considered throw your hat in the ring not interested you have an excellent chance with the police commission youre highly regarded at the moment i wont trade on the tragedy of my sons death forgive me thats not what i meant of course not agreed veronica headed downtown still stuck on the alert weve got a case that might involve bonds or certificates of some kind something that can be moved without a lot of attention or a lot of questions like bearer bonds we dont handle those here theyre disappearing they long ago stopped earning interest so its about parking money not earning our clients want to earn who does handle those i think i can put together a couple of names for you bearer bonds have a certain reputation you know drug dealers money launderers tax evaders exactly thats not where we want to be we dont want those folks sitting in our waiting room if you know what i mean on the other hand the last guy that brought bearer bonds in here was a priest so said somebody donated a quarter million in bonds to his church  when was that couple of weeks ago whered you send them thurmond bradley investments on wilshire theyre not so picky about whos in their waiting room  did you catch a name sorry i dont remember what about the church i dont think he ever said your namesake she relieved our lords suffering on his via dolorosa im afraid i was named for the veronica in the comic books you look more like betty to me oh it is a beautiful church weve been here a long time the neighborhoods changed but weve endured how long celebrated our anniversary last year the first armenian catholic church in california mazel tov what do you think its perfect well look at the calendar may and june book up first mrs sarkisian forgive me mrs allen but why our church you dont look armenian and your name my late husband changed it for business reasons  avakian ah it was his wish that our daughter have a traditional armenian wedding come to my office well look at some dates lovely i noticed youre in the middle of a capital campaign yes and i understand that its customary to make a donation at the time of the wedding customary not required perhaps in my husbands name that would be most generous of you mrs allen it would be my pleasure father please father tabakian he gave him those bonds for hiding her or for helping her some other way so lets hit thurmond bradley first then go lay it down for father t veronica off the yet boyle heights pleasant avenue queen of martyrs perfect two birds one stone ah there is still one sunday in june ive changed my mind father you dont want to book the wedding and im actually not interested in making a donation either i dont understand may i ask why id like to talk about a donation that was already made im sorry ten days ago you cashed bearer bonds in the amount of  you received those bonds from liliet saroyan my husbands mistress mistress im sure youre mistaken those bonds belong to me mrs allen i know liliet saroyan and i cant believe that what you say is true she came to you to talk about a wedding didnt she she did she said that she and her fiancÃ© is this your liliet layla yes but whos this her socalled fiancÃ© my husband they were lovers and the gift she gave you the bonds she stole those from me now you wouldnt want to be the recipient of such a tainted gift would you father born of an adulterous relationship i dont know what to say where is layla where is she and where is my money layla is gone she left the country to where i dont know  i havent heard from her liar please believe me and my bonds im sorry but i cashed the bonds the donation she made to the church is in the bank then you will write me a check for that amount im sorry i cant just do that without proof that the bonds this is your proof mrs allen look im sorry for your troubles but thats not proof i want my money im going to have to ask you to leave not without my fucking money you know im calling the police no you are not still here maybe theyre negotiating a settlement i could see how she can persuade him to give back the bonds and tell her where layla is  shes got game hes a priest hes a man isnt he what happened he attacked me wheres father tabakian hes hes hes in his office i had to defend myself  jerry i got her i want to talk to my lawyer i bet you do  william  im code at pleasant avenue

to you mr district attorney i agreed to accept the position of interim chief of police to honor my son and help lead the department out of this current crisis but i will not be accepting the job permanently no matter who wins the election youre just gonna walk away thats what interim means and the waits video they have it  who has it them  you didnt yes i did i think your grand jury should have all the facts if they want to sit in judgment they should know who ordered raynard waits cuffs removed they should know who ordered that field trip they should know who was really responsible you son of a bitch fuck you bosch so i happened to be doing my appointed rounds in the bullpen earlier i couldnt help but notice a delivery on your desk from archives two open cases from  good that was quick what was quick what are you doing i ordered two unsolveds from archives  your mothers case that was right it was im looking into the possibility these other two cases were connected unless i missed a memo you and edgar were assigned to the nash task force where are you going with this for now were just pushing paper for  tracing guns waiting for nash to raise his head  what about veronica allen she gets arraigned tomorrow edgars putting together the first discovery package its all well in hand so meantime over the weekend i got a call on my mothers case i spoke to a witness gave me a new lead  you got a call i got a call harry these cases are years old it doesnt matter forget our victims whats that say about us i know i know but we have a dedicated cold case unit downtown maybe but theyre not working these cases and you know how it goes down there they pull a case look for  and fingerprints to run if theres no magic bullet the case goes right back to archives so there was no  or fingerprint evidence in these cases  none all right so whats the connection whyd you pull them the connection is the city center hotel a friend of my mothers contacted me told me my mother went there the night she was murdered  this is new information okay i looked at the murder journals downtown in  and there were entries on two other cases associated with that place a woman was murdered there seven months after my mothers death another one was found wrapped in a bedspread in an alley off selma six month after that the bedspread came from the city center hotel  and the cause of death was the same in all three the guy was smart different mos different races on the victims the only connection is the hotel and that they were prostitutes harry this is the longest of longshots exactly why i pulled the files to dig in and see maybe we should loosen his shackles bosch just do it how the fuck did the times get this forget it pal come on barrel when are you getting that knee looked after  september till then hes got the gag walk what do you think it means above my pay grade cant say im sorry that it got out i think osheas run for mayor just took a tumble yeah huh okay im almost done for the day ill be there in about an hour tell your brother to have his shoes on and to be ready okay so we collected a total of six weapons at the bank plaza and shell casings two groups the nash crew and the marks crew what im focused on as a priority is the nash crew four weapons collected here here here and here this being where the submachine gun was recovered and what do you have so far four different weapons one thing in common obliterated serial numbers most likely with a metal sander which still gives us a halfway decent shot to restore the numbers with acid but it takes time we dont have time lester you cant force science the acids we use to restore serial numbers take a few days minimum to do their magic but call me tomorrow maybe ill have something anything on the ammo i should know well we could pretty much match each weapon to the casings by caliber and location everyone on nashs crew was shooting reloads  all four weapons correct nash is a firearms dealer makes sense he might recycle his brass did you find a reloader at his house no we did not   are you sure that coin you flipped came up heads caffrey come in  its you again yeah its me curry brand my favorite fox mitchell mr right to the point huh what was the name you heard me fox mitchell um his name in the murder book  no well then theres your answer if its not in the book its not part of the case except you got an anonymous call about him from a woman after they found my mother murdered she gave you the hotel name room number where she was killed does that ring a bell now detective caffrey cant say it does and how do you know i got the call could have been my partner could have been anybody she said she called the detective named in the newspaper you were the point man in the media your name in every story the city center hotel room  thats where she was killed before he dumped her body you knew you were told dont tell me what i fuckin knew or what i was told if its not in the book its not in the case end of story im gonna go out and smoke one of these cupcakes and youre gonna get the fuck out of here all these years ive been coming to you asking about her case listening to your bullshit but i know now caffrey i know you took a dive dont you bring that shit in here dont you fucking dare i cleared murder cases in my time you little shit so dont you come in here playing junior detective on my time who was fox mitchell  im telling you to get no im telling you she went to him that night she went to him and you knew you were told who was fox mitchell who was he fox mitchell was an alias okay  he was a snitch a snitch for who major narcotics and you were told to lay off him i got the message yeah loud and clear he was a prized and productive informant big arrests big seizures cocaine they wanted to keep him in place you didnt even talk to him off book i did the right thing i asked narcotics to make him available for questioning that request was denied so you just laid down on it  i had no choice fuck that no choice and what about his real name did you ever get it the assholes wouldnt give it to me and what about josephine ford and cindy black  who the fuck are they murder victims like my mother  never heard of them of course not you were too busy looking the other way bosch dont be so fucking judgmental you know the department you know how it works you get told to steer clear of something you steer clear or you get fucking rolled and how was i supposed to know for sure that this guy was even the killer she got killed and who gets her case you my mother got you she never had a chance  defendant allen up attorney conference now he went berserk yelling and screaming he picked up a pair of scissors so i i grabbed the closest thing i could put my hands on to defend myself and then he lunged at me and i i hit him  with the trophy yes and how many times did you hit him once or twice i dont i dont really remember i was terrified i thought he was gonna kill me  you feared for your life i did so is that enough i can work with this well dig deep into father tabakian find out all about him all his secrets right now hes the victim by the time we get to trial you will be yeah detective bosch ms chandler  didnt i say our paths would cross again yes you did cause according to you im the kind of guy who cant stop stepping on his own dick and once again youve proven me right youre defending veronica allen she called i accepted thought it was time to blow the dust off my criminal court skills highprofile case like this maximum media perfect win or lose cant bill the city for this one from what i hear the ladys near broke im not too worried about it i think she can scrape something together anyway its not about the money its the challenge and honestly when i heard your name catnip you two are made for each other i couldnt agree with you more how does the defendant plead not guilty your honor not guilty were talking about ignoring exculpatory evidence the detective in this case has a history of misconduct i proved that several months ago in the civil court and i fully expect to prove it again  and so it begins it never ended man yeah  what can i do for you thanks for the time  i work hollywood homicide i know who you are here so im working a case cold case a string of murders late early  a name keeps coming up as a possible witness it turns out the names an alias for a ci who was working for majors this guy was on keepaway status back then were looking at nearly years gone by so im thinking the cis probably not making cases anymore and you want the name its gotta be in one of these snitch boxes right it doesnt matter how many years ago it was you need command staff approval to access the ci files you have that what i got is a woman who was strangled and left in a dumpster another one stabbed and a third one beaten to death and nobody gave a shit about it back then because the one guy who might know something about it was making cases for major narcotics when i was a boot my to wrote me up three times for bullshit he was one of those guys took great joy in bending people over  ive known a few of those complete asshole which of course meant he rose through the ranks wormed his way up to captain then i heard last year a detective in hollywood division threw his ass through a plate glass window right in the fuckin watch office that really made my day we have a major operation going tonight i got here early to plan it out its gonna be a long one and i need to start stacking caffeine you want something from the break room ill probably brew a fresh pot itll take a while uh thanks i take it black okay back in a bit god damn you hey partner where you been downtown whats up i think ive got something here that we should take a look at  run it firearms pulled numbers on the weapons nash and his crew were using at the bank only partials on two of them but full serials on the other two nashs and ogradys beretta  you run them through  and heres the thing both weapons were originally bought by nash under his federal firearms license  bought legit completely legit and they were sold completely legit to a second party a hunting preserve and gun range up in canyon country  okay according to  but weapons were reportedly stolen last year during a burglary up at the hunting preserve they were among several guns reported stolen so they were stolen but then they end up back in the possession of the original dealer and somebody on his crew sounds like a big coincidence doesnt it whats that word you like cahoots thats what this is exactly i mean nash sells guns to this place then he steals them back takes off the serial number and gives them to his crew i mean the original buyer hes probably collecting insurance on the whole deal  thats like laundering weapons and something else all of the ammo that was used out there at the bank from these weapons reloads i mean every gun range ive been to has a reloader or sells recycled ammo so we better go up there and talk to this guy maybe get a line on nash i mean that would be the plan except for this donald boehner died eight months ago natural causes i called up there at the gun camp a recording came on said theyre no longer open for business  we check it out anyway yeah  chains been cut probable cause works for me pull it over here well go the rest on foot im gonna grab the tube back up lets wait and see what we got bosch im good   i aint coming out here vertical you know that dont you bosch thats up to you nash doesnt have to be that way whats the fuckin point trial prison fuck that youd rather die here oh you wanna make a deal harry i can give you veronica yeah pictures tapes i got it all right in here ill tie it up in a nice little bow for you or i can light it on fire while were waiting for  theres always a deal to be made nash put your weapons down thats where we start bullshit it

we have till then to change your mind detective you testified previously that when you encountered mrs allen in the church she was distraught she seemed to be yes there was blood on her right hand there was blood on her dress and upon entering father tabakians office what did you see he was lying on the floor the back of his head had been bashed in he was unresponsive not breathing a heavy trophy was lying nearby covered in blood and a pair of scissors had been placed under his left hand  placed that was my impression placed by whom in your opinion the defendant mrs allen you didnt witness her do that no were her fingerprints on the scissors no were any prints found on the scissors father tabakians what was your initial assessment at the scene that they had quarreled over the money that mrs allen had struck father tabakian with the trophy and then planted the scissors in his hand to make it look like selfdefense detective your partner testified that you told him from the beginning you believed the scissors were planted  that is correct you never considered that her story of selfdefense might be true considered and dismissed detective werent you a defendant in a civil suit where you were accused of planting evidence yes what was the outcome of that lawsuit the jury found for the plaintiff nothing further detective did the jury in that case conclude that you had planted evidence  no did the findings against you involve falsifying of evidence in any way no and the total amount in damages awarded to the plaintiff one dollar one dollar nothing further your honor the witness may step down ms chandler any other witnesses just one your honor the defense calls mrs anthony allen your honor given the late hour i suggest we recess for the day court will resume in the morning with mrs allens testimony senor bosch gracias gladys de nada  gracias de nada talk to your mom lately we skyped sunday you should make that a standing date once a week sunday well her

maddie its not an entertainment dad get real it so is an entertainment famous director kills an aspiring actress during sex all my friends think its cool that you were the one who arrested him hes not famous he is now i went there to get my money back the money your husbands mistress stole from you and gave to father tabakian i explained to him who she was and what shed done and how did he respond he defended her she was so innocent so pure he didnt believe me what did you do then i showed him the pictures of them together and how did he respond to that he he got so angry he told me to leave he said hed never give me my money back and then he threatened me he threatened you said hed call the police have me arrested then he he put his hands on me take your time thank you he began pushing me toward the door and he he picked up a pair of scissors and came at me again what did you do i grabbed the nearest thing i could to defend myself the trophy he lunged at me i thought he was going to kill me so i i i hit him i hit him i had no choice im so so sorry  as soon as possible right detectives mr district attorney kind of ballsy of her to put her client on the stand couldve backfired mrs allen was a compelling witness whats your gut well see i thought amanda did the best she could on the redirect given that you did lose that case dollar or no dollar i meant any guess on when the jury comes back if i were to bet tomorrow afternoon at the latest my office will give you a heads up shouldve taken that bet asshole headed back to the house i gotta go do this thing with benitez the holland case hows that going in a rational world itd be a slam dunk shes kind of a dish benitez is she i mean for someone whos age appropriate fuck you you ought to ask her out were working together thats never stopped you counselor does your client want to join us i know hes under house arrest but im sure hes allowed in the driveway hes fine where he is thank you on the night donatella spear was murdered that has not been proved counselor please on october of last year miss spear arrived at pm we have security data and video someone exited the house no video at pm mr holland and miss spear and through the main vehicle entrance minutes later he was driving her home after an evening of consensual relations hes a real gentleman she was already dead no alive and well  minutes from the house to the car and out the gate well theyd had a lot to drink theyd done some ecstasy and they were still in a lets call it a frisky mood making out parking ever do it bosch in your youth maybe he was trying to put a seat belt on a corpse someone mr holland presumably returned through that gate at am holland told us he dropped off spear at her house around midnight was back here by  thats nearly minutes unaccounted for he was mistaken about the time he was under the influence bosch who knows where the fuck the time goes right they were fucked up why would he lie about something thats so easy to check because hes an arrogant prick you would know let me ask you something rudy you miss the job fuck no not for a second i was never a lifer like you yeah right  years of just going through the motions but pimping for celebrities thats low thats low even for a bottom feeder like you bosch bosch bosch look at you most guys wouldve pulled the pin take the pension lean back enjoy life except you got none when the department finally puts you out to pasture youll eat your gun  minutes door to door in traffic that night that hour under ten ive been here at night its dark dark private he uses her keys drags her body up the stairs stages a scene theres your missing minutes he must have had help rudy taferos my bet weve been at this for months we dont have any evidence any witnesses ran the phone records no calls the place was wiped clean thats suspicious its all suspicious and if holland were an ordinary mook with a public defender hed be begging to cop a plea but hes a semifamous film director with a highpriced mouthpiece well i still think hell plead this is la i got two words for you dont say oj robert blake phil spector the exception that proves the rule so his story is they have sex he brings her home drops her shes still hot shes still high on the x he leaves she wants to get off again autoerotic asphyxiation is a male phenomenon  there are cases of females very few a few is all they need thats why your testimony is so important excuse me  jerry caught one partner  ill text the address on my way ill drop you at your car edge what you got white male thirties looks like a single  hard to tell heads like a baked apple no id you glove up before you went in powers yeah i did hes been cooking might want a hazmat to go with those gloves what was that about fucking bosch jerry de oppresso liber free the oppressed more like i was an oppressed man now im free fuck this harry this shit is hazardous to human health coroner can get the body out call for a tow crims can process this over at  air it the fuck out powers you run the plates im not a boot bosch ro comes back to a male in eagle rock who called it in shopping cart lady flagged us down door was open flapping in the breeze locks busted scenes fucked people in and out stealing shit  god knows what this suit is toast that looks kind of fresh i know that tag i might have a shake on him ill look its a waste a time its a homeless on homeless drug murder theres no way we clear this everybody counts or nobody counts written on the wall at  doesnt mean it always rings true here on the streets it should whatever come on harry that tattoo its an  tattoo army special forces special forces like green beret you got one too  want to see it ill pass lieutenant captain this thing is bullshit i dont disagree how are you feeling about the verdict confident from what i hear the defense scored some points off our people its just boilerplate blame the police your lead detective has a history he has a history of being accused where theres smoke not always sometimes its just somebody blowing it up your ass congrats on passing the written thanks nervous about the orals i dont see why the orals should be right up your alley excuse me here we go thats my key morning juan homicide hes out i used to say it as a joke you know gentlemen lieutenant say what as a joke whats going on why the long faces you know how i always introduce renee as the future exmrs johnson i thought that was funny you know given my matrimonial history and barrel i am so sorry whatre ya gonna do no retirement for you pal now youre stuck with me fuck you im not sticking around just to keep you company  yeah you are no im not you guys headed downtown yeah just leaving so is it good sign or a bad sign who knows good sign the jurys out two days thats a bad sign do you need to take some time better to stay busy but thanks lieutenant all right if you need anything let me know boy shes all right grace nobody like her fucking hate to see her make captain are you serious no telling who wed end up with i feel the same way anything we can do to fuck up her chances just keep doing what were doing jesus you guys selfish assholes im just joking i mean you know we wish her the best you know she deserves to make captain right fuck that itd be a calamity ill light a candle ive been informed that the jury finds itself still deadlocked and that further deliberations would be fruitless therefore on the single count of murder two the people of california versus veronica allen i declare a mistrial no jeopardy attaches the defendants bond is released what does that mean no jeopardy they can retry you thats not fair well dont worry about it yet lets celebrate this victory this is a good thing ronnie this is not over detective seven to five for acquittal why would the next jury find you any more persuasive than this one did trust me the district attorney will weigh the odds  and cut his losses the  will retry ill make it my mission you are a dog with a bone and you mrs allen are a liar and a murderer you really do need to get a life detective i still owe you that drink ring my bell any time ouch must be so sore by now most of the usable prints belong to a william meadows  military howd you know  the tattoos howd you know documents in the van pertaining to a staff sergeant william meadows and letters addressed to a billy meadows he the deceased waiting on the autopsy for an id theyre super backed up over there he the owner of this little slice of heaven we think so any prints besides meadows  a multitude coppers said the place was ransacked after he died homeless on homeless right most likely the peoples case was flimsy and the jury agreed bet it was the men voted to acquit i hear you brother id acquit that any day they heard the testimony they found mrs allen more compelling you guys do look shifty like a couple of saltandpepper shakedown artists preying on lonely widows shake this well were disappointed but this office will study the events of this trial before we decide whether to retry mrs allen whether to retry are you kidding me that chickenshit excuse me mr district attorney benitez bosch anita was just bringing me up to speed on the holland case all right i have to tell you after what happened today im concerned dont be and since you brought it up the allen case which way are you leaning ive made up my mind this office will not file new charges against veronica allen hold on a minute youre shitting me honey chandler has painted an indelible portrait of you detective one that cannot be erased that you cant be trusted that youll do anything say anything cut any corner to win thats bullshit i dont do that you have that reputation detective deserved or not

careful shut get that thing out of my freaking face okay lovely theres that tell me about this statement from mr holland detective we were packed up leaving camera was off i was last one out because i needed to give him a copy of the search warrant and i did so at the door mr fowkkes did you witness this no i was on a uh phone call your honor  in another room mr holland asked me if we had found what we were looking for i said no and as we walking outside he said and you wont either sounds like he was professing his innocence those were his words but that wasnt his tone of voice tone of voice your honor really let him finish what was his tone taunting at that point mr holland wasnt officially a suspect so i took a wild shot i said you did it didnt you he smiled and said and ill get away with it too your honor no one else heard this alleged conversation  except detective bosch and thats not all  he said one more thing go on mr holland looked at me and said i am a god in this town detective and you dont fuck with the gods preposterous your honor detective bosch has a long history of investigative misconduct your honor a defendants own voluntary outofcourt statements are a hearsay exception and can be used against him at trial shes right mr fowkkes detective bosch fabricated this entire conversation and youre welcome to attack the credibility of the witness the jury will sort it out its called a trial no no no no no do not do the unringing the bell trope no do not go there not in my court your motion to suppress the testimony of detective bosch is denied death report on gunn be sure to tell bosch i omitted the part where he fucked up the crime scene with his prints no way on a glass with whiskey in it harry always gloves up apparently not always i saw him glove up jimmy lab dont lie j edgar i should probably tell billets but you know im not that kind of guy robertsons writeup on gunn pretty thin guess an elephant hunter doesnt want to waste too much time with small game says you left prints at the scene robertsons full of shit never happened look at my screen harry its not just jimmy saying it its latent prints ah shit i took off my glove to work my phone screen the picture i sent to oshea of the suicide note i must have moved the glass to get a clear shot is he being all selfrighteous about this yeah but he left it out of the report so theres that you headed back downtown annabelle crowe dress rehearsal hows our meadows warrant oh im on it almost done youre not writing a novel the jurys gonna wonder why you waited a year to call the police i was embarrassed okay andrew holland is an important person in my business is that why you didnt show the bruises on your neck to anyone why you erased his voicemail message i just kept thinking like what if i had it wrong you know you hear about hollywood people weird sex i dont know maybe i was just being a prude not chill enough about it okay dinner drinks back to andrew hollands house it all seemed perfectly normal yes we did some molly fooled around clothes came off  consensual yeah but he didnt like me touching him he wanted to control everything after a while he moved behind me i felt his hands around my neck he squeezed i couldnt breathe did you tell him to stop i tried i couldnt i couldnt speak i tried to get out from under him but he was too strong and then he was he was moving inside me and it was all i could do to just and then nothing i blacked out i woke up alone in his bed naked on top of the covers i could hear the shower running i found my clothes in a bag in a black plastic garbage bag by the bedroom door my purse had been emptied out i saw my phone but i couldnt find my keys i started to get dressed and i heard the shower stop i grabbed the whole bag and i ran out the door down the driveway through the front gate and i hid in the shadows and got dressed and i walked until i had cell phone reception so i could call a cab and why not the police right then he had already left me a voicemail on my cell worried about where id gone saying id forgotten my keys and saying he was sorry that things had gotten carried away and he he thought i was really into it he just wanted to satisfy me did he explain why he had to take a shower after hed choked you out what did you think the garbage bag meant the empty purse i dont know he was getting rid of the evidence he thought you were dead bosch let her tell it her way i tried to forget about it but when i read about him being arrested for the murder of donatella spear i thought if i had said something she might still be alive no she wouldnt a guy like this keeps stretching till he snaps youre just lucky it wasnt you howd he seem bosch wound up really anxious to talk to that knucklehead bosch said gunn was too drunk to talk yeah he was out i felt bad when i called him gunn was conscious otherwise i wouldnt have called him at home at that hour youve called bosch on gunn before oh yeah going back at least three four times on my watch  j edgar hey coroner ruled gunns death a homicide somebody held him by the ankles and dropped him on his head congratulations means i probably wont be able to protect harry from his fuckup with the prints its gonna come up no doubt ladies whoa good god man dont drink that you out of your mind ugh this is crates brew this shit tastes like its fashioned from pencil shavings gugh here take that ugh all right jerry do not tell anyone green mountain kenyan i have to hide it from the hoi polloi okay so that my friend will set the world right on its axis and your bowels will thank me later probably like that yeah but if you turned it around if it was like this if this means anything why do you keep looking at that gunns now a murder drop seemed odd you still worrying over my prints jerry youre not how was crowe i dont know theres something shes holding back about holland or herself somewhere in the intersection benitez agree with you she thinks im hung up on all the ones that got away perceptive fuck you all right every police officer brings different needs and values values and perceptions to the workplace so special yes come in you got a minute lieutenant oh sure come sit down let me know if harry looks over or starts to come in whats going on hey you all right why do i seem off a little more opaque than the usual sorry i got a lot going on we both do are we good oh im gonna take another hard look at annabelle crowe i never doubted you would then were good shit thats what i keep saying still it doesnt exactly add up to harrys come off the chain and become an avenging angel hes been a different person since he solved his moms murder her killer got away with it edward gunn got away with two at least and veronica allen walked harrys a lot of things but he is not a cold blooded i agree with you i agree but hes lying about his prints and i dont know what else shit robertson is a good detective a lot like harry hes old school dogged  i know i mean ask yourself this right if harry found your prints  at the murder scene here he comes you see what im saying i do come in hey gotta go pick up my daughter okay  signed off on the warrant so ill swing by court in the morning and meet you at the bin okay im out you have a good night rick jackson was harrys partner on the original gunn investigation he works pacific now four years with bosch burned him out  he fled to the beach seriously we can compare scars youre gonna have to work this subrosa stay ahead of robertson find out what the fuck is going on hey light good night good night im tired later bro you were right check it out its like gunn was clawing at the opening to keep from getting taken through it not on the wall by the door leading out where he went over  because he where presumably hed be fighting even harder to stay inside unless he couldnt what was his tox level borderline uh i mean or something its not likely he passed out yeah but he could have been made to between here and there you bring the murder book you learned carotid restraint control at the academy right a pain in the ass to get right you get it wrong it turns into a choke hold people die some of the time we saw abrasion patterns on suspects backs like this think about the way we brace the hold one arm around the neck the other one across the back so you can control the pressure on the neck arteries  with the angle of your arm mmhmm now these half circles are abrasions caused by the bands and bezels of those chunky chrono wristwatches us og cops tend to favor a cop made gunn pass out then dragged him to the balcony and dropped him head first not definitively military teaches it mixed martial arts anyone can find a howto on the internet or a cop of a certain age yeah my age jesus cross los angeles street suddenly im in calcutta dark side of gentrification how much you wanna bet those milliondollar lofts got windows facing the other way patty my partner harry bosch hi patty sorry im late  is digging random holes on temple trying to see how far back they can hold things up you should get a traffic app for your phone detective then we could watch his head explode we go in here so patty how secure are these well they need  to get in but we tell them not to leave anything too valuable they have to come back every week to renew and demand is high theres never enough lets see meadows  oh youre just in time we were about to empty his bin and give it to somebody else there  thank you mmhmm lieutenant grace billets sir hi grace billets oh grace billets grace have a seat please thanks you want a water or something uh no thanks okay lets get to it we have minutes so please be concise as you can  ill try first off an easy one mmhmm briefly tell us about yourself and why you think you should be promoted to captain well my dad was a cop my uncle worked valley division i was born here i grew up in this city and i still live here so i think that being a legacy and a resident gives me a pretty clear perspective on community policing a persons whole life reduced to what fits in a garbage can this his foot locker no thats a pelican case thats what you use when you get out of the service not when you go in as a boot hunting trophy theres a false bottom he did multiple tours iraq afghanistan went back as a hired gun too the girl they seem so sure of themselves you have to be because after that youre never so sure again i ever tell you how i got rid of the tats on my hands no hold fast hold fast to what life brother everything anything you could grab on to to keep from going under shit i was just a kid saw it on tuna guys down in pedro exnavy some kind of sailor thing yeah so anyways a couple years later i enlisted in the army my sergeant at basic saw it and flipped out said theres no way he was gonna have a squid tattoo on one of his soldiers so he makes me go out behind the back of the barracks and punch this cinderblock wall till my knuckles were like hamburger when they scabbed over he made me go back out do it again and again thats crazy i was all in with it thats how sure we were stress can be a huge factor frustration with the slow churn of justice but if you tell people exactly what they need to do and why the majority respond very positively and often exceed expectations last question is situational mmhmm a lieutenant under your direct command has had an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her detectives this detective comes to you and says that an unhappy end to the affair is now affecting her caseload and her path to promotion how would you handle this hey ive got so much math tonight how was practice awesome i learned how to hit a pipe excuse me its a back row attack short set behind the middle

rocks you know maddie it shouldnt matter what the cool girls think yeah i know it shouldnt hes my inspector javert relentless in his pursuit of false justice the full weight of a corrupt system brought to bear on me by its woefully inept agent provocateur les miz sterling hayden in the godfather character name captain mccluskey  dudley smith la confidential hes your porfiry petrovich crime

her clients vengeance boils in harry boschs blood it all gives me the chills but like any good villain bosch sees this world through the narrow filter of his broken childhood he wants to save his

follow all the rules and regs he was accused of planting a gun rudy accused not proven whats the difference as soon as its introduced its a skunk in the jury box the recent allen case as a witness

what they have  even if it points at your buddy here hey stop just stop this is blood under the bridge can we move on i dont know can we i apologize for not looping you in sooner as to what we were thinking listening holland had gunn killed and then he staged it to implicate bosch the glass with harrys prints the owl the quote thats a frame god sees in latin give me a break fuck your owl im not buying it  motive to smear bosch discredit his testimony before the trial and who hit gunn wasnt holland hes under house arrest tafero rudy was around when i caught the gunn case he knows what it meant to me so they whacked gunn to frame you thats a long drive brother you know what you dont need to buy it you just need to solve it can you do that  gunns murder mmhmm  yes maam all right and anderson i dont care where he got the tip  you back him off roger that i can tell you exactly where he got it why dont you go to hell harry all right great now that we are all one big happy family again lets put the personal shit aside and get to it hey harry the kid that was killed the other night by the hollywood bowl its connected to the meadows murder be a coincidence if its not wounds indicate an expertise in killing knowledge of anatomy looks military stabbed in the neck here hit the vagus nerve immobilizes the victim down stroke cuts the bleeders two quick cuts precise bled out in seconds wow jesus harry whered you learn that q corps special forces close quarter combat  i think the killer had spec ops training okay but why why kill the kid possible witness was he  he didnt see a thing uh i should have been more careful and not talked to him in public  i put him at risk okay dont go there it goes where it goes detective join me no thanks this wont take long how long you looking at a job for the murder of edward gunn youve been told to shut it down im not shutting anything down its a coverup the suspect is not with the you lied to me i was mistaken this is so fucked up  i apologize you apologize fuck you this is my ass what if i had run that story lucky you didnt ha if it comes out that you falsely accused one of your own and how would that happen word gets around dont fuck with me anderson veteran detective points finger at a fellow officer and then recants possibly under pressure whats really going on in the gunn case  coverup thats my story go ahead and write it and ever department source you ever had will dry up like the la river the koreatown killer aka  first became active four years ago half a dozen robbery assaults four carjackings three shootings two murders incidents occurring roughly every six months how do we know its the same guy every time same gun all three shootings prints on one bike match prints found on another victims vehicle  from several scenes eyewitness descriptions pretty consistent too its the same guy and we still dont have a suspect not in the system never been arrested or served in the military or worked for the post office or taught school i get it always on a bicycle its his signature well why koreatown are these hate crimes are they targeting koreans we dont think so the victims have been white and black as well as korean hes an opportunist not a racist he may just live in the neighborhood the latest carjacking victim helped us develop a new sketch lets get this out to the public not a good idea sir well be overwhelmed with false sightings well keep it close circulate it internally its your call soon you wont have to sit through any more of these hows that the short list is getting shorter bradley walker wants nestor delgado no comment you dont care i dont know where to start delgado hes young hes smart one of ours came up through the ranks a rising star in the department thanks to friends in high places like walker hes a climber not a cop plus hes green he doesnt know what he doesnt know hes not my first choice  but besides i thought you couldnt appoint a latino that was before the election now i can do whatever the fuck i want and you want delgado walker does and the rest of the commission will go along youre playing me hector you know damn well delgado is not a good choice i want you irv but if you wont take the job grab those drinks for me will you sharkeys mother blames herself do me a favor let her know about the victims assistance fund  for the funeral costs done gentlemen this is detective bosch he wants to ask you a few questions taco supreme was sharkeys jam hey respect man sorry about your friend sure you are last time you saw sharkey you were running your flimflam right now we can cut you some slack on that but we need to know what happened that night anything you can tell us car he got into black beemer fuck what the fuck man there you go you do know something theres only about a million of those douchey cars around here did you make the driver couldnt really see him it was with tinted windows tall short black white anything this is how you do your friend look at this aw shit i dont want to see that look at this this is him killed like an animal and you play dumb i can kind of picture the dude in my head im not sure how to describe him then dont motherfucker keep your fucking mouth shut take this punk back to west hollywood and drop him on the street our pleasure give me that im going to show you some photos okay go ahead the driver may or may not be in the pictures i dont want you to feel like you got to pick one maybe this one right here and him you sure could have been ill use a security guy to establish when donatella arrived and when holland left and came back that night the missing minutes which will contradict his original statement to the detectives when he was staging the scene mmhmm after the security guy the  evidence defense will say the sex was consensual and well say that donatella thought she was engaging in consensual sex but holland had intended to kill her all along intention its a high bar annabelle crowe will testify how he choked her during sex until she passed out and how his actions afterwards indicate he thought she was dead he was prepared to get rid of her body excellent that establishes his homicidal proclivities the premeditation is there a problem shes nervous shit how nervous hollands people let her know that they know she works as an escort witness intimidation i dont think it rises to that as far as we know they havent threatened her when did you speak to her last bosch is staying in touch with her its not going to be a problem word to the wise anita anything other than a professional relationship with detective bosch is a bad idea and not my style careful might be an  sting  s after you pal not me obviously this is mine fell out of my pocket if you say so what you got there autopsy notes on sharkey wounds indicate the weapon had a curved blade  inches from tip to hilt and the car sharkey got into on saturday night one of his boys thinks maybe xavi moreno was driving might not be enough for a warrant but enough to go rattle his cage coming am i invited you can thank robertson why robertson for being an even bigger asshole than you are follow me looks like

worry that this is another example of your loose supervision of your people i will happily put my peoples case clearance rate up against any other detectives in the city youve seen the numbers you know what weve done it speaks for itself and for the quality of your command youre too familiar with them grace you like them too much if you need me to take the heat with chief irving for my decision

us medals hey whos the one that said this old guy was nothing to worry about that was before he kept showing up like a bad acid flashback look stay mindful stay disciplined on mission were good if i see him again i dont know the weeds talking shit to you woodrow go surf chill yeah hey put this somewhere safe huh duh print was on the side of the camera housing from all the dust over it probably not new the guy who set up the system that would be my first guess when he unpacked it maybe no gloves you run it am i the detective of course i ran it got a name and  number ooh mark taylor  teacher

right here i can just get a ride home from practice dad laurens mom said you can stay at their house until im done today you called laurens mom i feel like im under house arrest aw mads come on did you talk to mom about the travel team  detective bosch i got to let coach know detective bosch whats the real story with this gunn murder youre a part of you guys couldnt find a kardashian to creep are you his daughter so bosch this guy youre chasing him for years he just turns up dead you dont see the coincidence in that no no comment detective andrew holland has tweeted that youre a serial liar no comments tweet this asshole best not to engage uch like youd know what does that mean where do you think i learned it you said you wanted to be a cop eyes on the road  and  sometimes getting in the way is part of the job pissing people off comes with the territory your territory how come jerry never has stupid stuff happen to him i dont know maybe hes just not as pretty as i am if only plastic owls could talk oh it would save me from this for sure ive got local stores left to contact about sales records anything new on gunns a couple of decent prints we missed the first time entry door face plate and latch bolt like whoever broke in held his finger up against it after he picked it open security chain potter noticed the top of the door was scuffed killer snagged the chain with fishing line looped it up over the door and slid the guard frame sounds like a twoman job sounds like an assumption educated guess when you do it its an educated guess but when i do it its an assumption got to be cash they shipped back all the pieces line up  not this cash though no too long ago but probably where they got the idea in the first place goshen says theres more money floating around afghanistan now than there was in iraq less oversight but why not i dont know drugs or weapons anything else they bring in theyre going to take a huge hit on when they try to sell it here cash is cash yeah but they still have to launder it well but nobody gives a shit about that on this end except for maybe the taxes perfect crime till sharkey unraveled it where have you been theres a crowe problem shes in europe shooting a  show harry damn it god if you wouldve just there was nothing we could have done this is pure holland he pulled some strings got her a part she was probably making her connection at frankfurt while you were still leaving her messages they tampered with my fucking witness add that to all the other things we have to prove we get together tonight figure out where were going to go from here i cant im sorry okay tomorrow ill see how my day goes we should put eyes on dobbs and marino in case they try to book billets is going to pitch a fit about extra bodies on overtime youre already in the doghouse ill write it up if you pretend it was your idea swell love that holiday vibe all the festive traditions those special smells  rÃ¤ven raskar Ã¶ver isen  rÃ¤ven raskar Ã¶ver isen  detective chief would like a word im guessing he means you note the time and date in case i never come back wash j edgar whats up quick question about bosch im starting to understand why you and  like the guy so much hes smart loyal hes a pretty damn good detective if you push past the dark part plays it too close to the edge for my taste but okay he gets results where is this going jimmy well i cant stop asking myself what bosch knows about gunn he isnt telling us ask him have you this doesnt get us to who killed the man jimmy come on nobody wants to be in a position where the guy whos got your back  cant be straight with you you know what i really dont feel comfortable having this conversation with you about my partner hey believe me ive got no skin in im just passing through but let me guess  yeah short list for the next desk or so they say great just make sure you dont step over harry to get there thats not what this is i hope not may i ask where were going in circles should be a familiar journey for you harry bosch detective  nearly sworn officers in the los angeles police department tell me why i spend so much of my time dealing with the shit you stir up i just try to keep my head down do my job chief not even remotely true which of course is the quality that recommends you and indicts you depending those qualities werent a problem when you needed my help id like not to hear the name bosch in my morning briefing anymore how can we make that happen you could always fire me short of that sir i have no control over what people do or say about me if youre expecting me to cut you slack for your current misadventures youre mistaken i do not expect anything oh i think you do and i think if youre not careful it will eat you alive thanks for the ride any time see you after practice what did you do with the ticket i gave you harry didnt it get tossed i got a reminder notice in the mail yesterday  ah shit theyre going to drop an arrest warrant on me i tried im sorry its all these new rules and regulations okay but y in the old days i could have just reached out to the motor cop have him bang in sick on the day of court  okay

caper i cant do it sorry three homicides down one of thems a kid you dont even know for sure if they got their shipment yet we dont want to lose these guys if you and bosch can find time in your eighthour day to sit and watch them then knock yourselves out but i cant justify the extra manpower and overtime until you get something more concrete same as it ever was cut her some slack harry damn composite went out wider than we hoped now were spending half our time vetting calls from patrol cops convinced they found our guy though it was a gamble in a serial case and the  weve asked  for an expedited familial database run well see if we can find a relative work that way they giving you the usual runaround let me make a call this is so fucked up if he goes to ground again well be waiting

rights act familiar with the lybarger that a question i have your complaint history here i know how you feel about  i dont see how you could that were out for scalps thats not me right lets get started shall we have you seen the cell phone video  yes does it clearly depict your interaction with district attorney oshea yes do these photographs accurately illustrate specific moments from that encounter conduct unbecoming clearly add to that the obligation of  officers to provide close cooperation with prosecutors as stated in the manual and we have a problem agreed may i ask you a question well if its relevant you ever worked a case for two years then had the  kick it cause it wasnt a slamdunk because he was more concerned with his winloss record than obtaining justice because thats what this encounter was about thats your rationale duly noted i lost my temper sergeant theres no contesting it but i know oshea didnt file this  he didnt have to did he sign on to it no he declined he was the injured party public perception of the department is also the injured party ill be writing a  and requesting the chief support mediation like the last time and the next youre predictable detective  i got a feeling that i cant let go  i got a feeling that i cant let go  i got a feeling that i cant let go  i got a feeling that i cant let go  i got a feeling that i cant let go  i got a

as the guy drinking with gunn the week before his murder jesse wanted to be a cop too like his big brother what happened tanked the exam didnt make it into the academy mmhmm chip on his shoulder maybe he wants to prove hes smarter than us no doubt id like to get him in here as a wit not a suspect he works security at an apartment complex on hollywood near argyle  guard supervisor well thats good he wont want to talk in front of his guys try to get him here make him think its his idea if you can thats the right play and if his watch looks like it matches those marks well swab it for how are you gonna get it well ask him and if he wont go along plan b arrest his ass okay step at a time pierce do a warrant for the swab mmhmm you know rudy came up when we did maybe he taught jesse how to do it you can learn the chokehold anywhere off the internet maybe you think rudy was there too that he did gunn well its not a stretch jesses brother hollands muscle well we got nothing on rudy that puts

shortcuts he just wanted to take fountain tell me ms benitez why shouldnt i admit testimony from detective boschs civil trial its irrelevant defenses intent here is obvious and exclusively prejudicial it establishes a disturbing and careerlong pattern of rogue behavior by detective bosch it does nothing of the kind rumors and allegations and theres nothing there in that transcript that impeaches boschs long record of veracity under oath  your honor mr fowkkes youve made your point ms benitez i denied mr fowwkes motion to suppress boschs account of his conversation with mr holland and his putative confession did i not yes your honor and correctly so what i did not do is immunize detective bosch from crossexamination and if youre unhappy with my decision you can always revisit a plea agreement with mr fowkkes before the jury is seated motion denied your honor if i may is this a new motion ms benitez no your honor what about you mr fowwkes well were ready to proceed to trial your honor then well schedule voir dire to commence next week did you forget about me nobody stopped in to offer you coffee water typical very sorry what can we get you you can get this moving i need to

hope theyre working the riverwatch arson case  so it was arson thats the ruling but we havent gone public with it yet we have some questions about the deceased retired detective john caffrey caffrey was the target origin point of the fire was his bed staged to look like he fell asleep smoking but the chemical analysis shows the presence of an accelerant was he alive when the fire started cant say the body was so badly burned we may never know the cause of death the apartment was gutted but we have the front desk visitor logs you were a regular visitor during the seven years he lived there i was he was lead on my mothers murder  it was unsolved and i visited him every few months to pick his brain about it a year and a half ago you stopped visiting him yeah i cleared the case your mother was marjorie phillips lowe thats right the case is still carried as open i cleared it to my satisfaction the killers dead i just never got around to filing it cleared other did caffrey help you clear it he did but he also revealed that he bowed to departmental pressure to look the other way at the time so the killer was never brought to justice before he died and why would caffrey do that the killer was a highlevel snitch for narcotics my mother was just a prostitute he mattered she didnt so thats the real reason i stopped visiting him a year and a half ago caffrey told you he was pressured by the department  he did he wasnt just covering his own ass i looked into it he was telling the truth thank you and thanks for your time you know caffrey kept a full murder book on the case did he you didnt know news to me  thanks mmhmm you think theres any connection at all to your mothers case jesus grace i dont know but if his place was gutted by a fire where did he keep the murder book why all good questions  shit what something i forgot to do hey meg have you seen captain lewis um not in today or the rest of the week oh wow under the weather no taking some personal time she said huh  terry santi so you followed my advice dont i always thank you  scott anderson mmhmm quite the writer yeah it turned out all right i know you got your eyes on  yeah but the politics involved

same kind of one was used on sharkey ah copy that listen harry go do your  statement i got them to agree that the walkthrough can wait till tomorrow maddie has been calling every five minutes what if youd been killed i did my best to minimize the possibility of that happening but still what if anything maddie didnt happen it could some cops go their entire career without ever firing their weapon

that rock every joint in my body aches sorry i couldnt be there for dobbs no youre arent you get seasick remember when they kicking you loose tomorrow maybe anything i can do for you nah harry we need to talk about what in person you gonna tell me youre gonna retire facetoface okay ill swing by all right detective bosch i represent the estate of the recently deceased john caffrey john caffrey detective bosch mrs niese i was coming to see you no got me out of the house heres just a few of his personal belongings he left behind at the shelter they didnt know where to send them dune tommy loved the sandworms christ i thought he pawned this it was my dads you find who did it detective we did yeah you kill him no but somebody else did you have my card if you need anything yes i do yeah right this way you reliving your glory years bosch i maybe saw malibu once growing up from the window of a bus caffrey sent it to me from the grave sort of lawyer instructions in the event of death why would caffrey send you his high school yearbook dont know its not his either nobody named caffrey in it well before you get too hung up where are we on trevor dobbs just finishing up the filing package for the  venturas got him on a bus to la county  why dobbs lawyer called his client wants to talk to you wants to clear things up thatll be a neat trick make sure you get audio for the jury if mr dobbs is guilty of anything it is of possessing money that has not even been reported stolen that is the total of his involvement in this matter he cannot be held responsible for the actions of two contract employees who took it upon themselves to rip off some warlord in afghanistan he killed or ordered the deaths of william meadows cornell jackson xavi moreno and thomas niese a boy who never posed any threat to them oh bullshit that is fucking ridiculous that is a wild allegation detective and you have no proof of any of it no proof that xavi moreno is even dead in fact hes the one you should be out looking for hes on a beach somewhere in mexico while you falsely charge a war hero and an innocent man whyd your client try to kill me on the island i didnt know who was hunting me you mightve been xavi sounds like you knew what he was up to detective we came to you today in good faith howd you know id work lateral and come in above you id have done the same it was the tactically sound move hmm and suckered me into those trip lines calculated risk the longer it went the less i liked my chances wheres the stern anchor the what from your boat im guessing its at the bottom of the pacific somewhere half the chain wrapped around xavi morenos neck again that is a completely unfounded assertion we found blood in the deck seams match that to moreno and maybe weve got a no body case maybe we dont well see well see know what your biggest mistake was dobbs keeping the knife it was hidden under the seat cushion oh hmm its not mine news to me the lab took it apart this morning they found blood under the pivot screw seeped in there where you cant clean it out if that blood turns out to be sharkeys its adios motherfucker for you thats not my fucking knife that was xavis was doesnt matter whose it was its who has it thats you you still have to explain why it was on your boat in your possession when xavi moreno is supposedly on a beach somewhere in mexico yeah anything else you want to clear up counselor mr dobbs didnt think so you know theres nothing worse than a leader who betrays his own troops in country that gets you the death penalty right there but to kill a boy for what im going to make sure you live the rest of your life in the black echo you said you know who killed her he called himself mitch its the only name i ever knew him by the registers are in the back in the cabinets mitch fox mitchell was an alias okay he was a snitch youve tied epperson to your mothers murder i was afraid i would find you here been a month without it talk to me bosch i shouldve fucking known arno epperson  fox mitchell the man who murdered your mother or so i thought i mean i knew he was protected by the department or somebody who had power over the department bradley walker he and arno were tight the police commission president his father more or less ran the city council for three decades why would bradley walkers father run interference and protect epperson on a murder it doesnt make any sense that he would take that risk not for his sons fuckup friend i know i had it wrong you had what wrong it was the other way around it was all about protecting bradley and arno epperson was part of it youre saying bradley walker killed your mother im saying this isnt over im going to find out hello so you decided to return my property nice of you after a year and a half well the case has been under investigation i needed to hang on to it a little longer oh you return it now so case solved  still working it oh hey i remember you telling me that you were an employee here since back in  summer of to be exact i want you to look at some pictures mm no cant say as i ever seen him before you sure im not a hundred percent sure i mean its a long time ago how about these hmm mmmm mmmm mmmm oh yeah him who could forget that cocky mug he used to come here i remember chevy convertible party boy the paytoplay girls i had to tell him to keep it down more than a few times when oh uh same time late seventies eighties but not with this other guy no no he was straight he liked the loose girls with the loose legs loose morals no i i didnt mean it that way i mean like did these two run together not that i remember but he rented rooms yep thats what were here for his names not in the book oh back then if people paid cash i never asked them too many questions they could write down ronnie reagan for all i cared and some of them did nowadays everybody wants to pay with plastic oh i check the s on that thanks yeah all right walker and epperson knew each other what does it mean it means i had it wrong i have a guy he identifies walker as a regular at the city center hotel the place my mother went the night she was murdered my guy doesnt  epperson but eppersons alias fox mitchell turns up repeatedly in the guest register  and walker and epperson were asshole buddies since high school theres no reason to think that they werent still hanging out in their  walker knows about eppersons life as an protected snitch with an alias he uses eppersons alias to rent rooms at the city center hotel for liaisons with prostitutes so walker killed your mother now thats your theory do you have any idea how you sound i do but that yearbook came from caffrey  says caffrey was the target of the arson at river watch somebody wanted to wipe him out and whatever he had in that apartment but his lawyer had the yearbook yeah and caffrey kept a copy of my mothers murder book somewhere else somewhere safe and  found it so what do you want me to do bosch call  tell them youve taken a personal interest in the case and ask for a briefing when they mention finding my mothers murder book ask for a copy ill take it from there you want me to help you conduct a secret investigation of the man who is scheduled to pin the stars on my collar dont you want to know if that mans a murderer i got daddys bag i called it its not fair jack youre bigger be bigger  ohh thank you mmhmm mom can we open the cheetos  yes no dont spoil your lunch you gonna be okay here by yourself i could get willis to come and stay with you for a couple of days willis itd be me taking care of him tell me youre going to quit jerry take your pension call it a day what else would i do i dont know sell houses get your masters watch your boys grow up i will dont worry i like my job im good at it yeah i know you are so you go back does that mean going back to partner with harry bosch lets take a walk ill pretend its exercise its not like poker is exactly aerobic find a place to live yet everythings so expensive we may need you to move back to vegas bullshit you need to bring me in all the way that was our deal when you asked for my help the director is extremely happy with what youve accomplished you are in but in an outside kind of way for how much longer hows reggie i dont like keeping secrets from him or maddie or harry bosch for that matter look jay i got you what you wanted were greedy bastards what can i say you can say welcome back to the bureau agent wish give me a desk and a badge soon i forgot what assholes you guys really are caffrey kept it in a safe deposit box extortion  thinks so  months ago caffrey started making deposits in his bank account  in cash every month source unknown right after i went to him about fox mitchell yes so caffrey sends me in the wrong direction after epperson turns around extorts walker pay up or i give bosch the true story walker gets tired of paying all theory no evidence if theres evidence ill find it call me when you do wheres mom i dont know dad we need to go to the store the fridge is bare okay make a list ill take care of it mom is even worse about it than you are how did you two ever survive why do you think i know all the best takeout places what are you doing i thought you solved that i did there might be somebody else just checking what must be hard going through that again not really ancient history toronto  lt hey you going stircrazy yet no im good look um has bosch talked to you about this latest rabbit hole hes going down hes been dodging my calls what now of course i want you there we just need to be discreet there is nothing inappropriate about this relationship i know that its just would you excuse me for a moment this wont take long hmm of course  bosch back in  caffrey got called to city hall to brief a councilman bradley walker sr on my mothers case alone its in caffreys copy of the investigative chronology not in the official murder book is there a summary report on the briefing no nothing the murder book was sanitized after caffrey met with walker as ive said this isnt proof of anything the mayor city council members they ask for briefings all the time walker seniors name in the book doesnt add up to extortion or murder its walker i know it you know it otherwise caffrey wouldnt have sanitized the record i suggest you stand down detective and see where bennett and pell go with it theyll never get close to him it starts with walker then you trace it back to the torch not the other way around bosch this is not your case its been my case since i was years old did you ask bennett and pell for regular updates i did let me know what you know chief do that and ill keep you out of this bosch morning morning am i taking maddie to school or are you shes driving im closing my eyes i heard that hows the house hunt ive got four appointments this morning of course if theres anything i like im gonna run it by you maddie why if were going to live there i want you to have a say i live here are you gonna eat that cold mom you have reggie harrys alone live wherever you want ill come and visit but im gonna stay with dad what have you done with my daughter youre looking in the mirror  thats harsh not at all i wouldnt have it any other way hell things are so its probably better that she stays with you why eleanor whats going on with you what happened in hong kong powers you volunteer for this i did yeah they got a bunch of us taking shifts i may just learn to like you yet jerry harry hey i didnt hear the door oh your security let me in yeah uh i cant bring myself to tell them to go home and thank you shit you didnt have to everybodys droppin stuff off like i died or something how you feeling on the mend staying ahead of the pain working a case on your down time uh no not really you catch a new one still writing up dobbs jimmy robertson brought me the rudy tafero interview why would he bring you that you tell me im good howd you know they were driving a cadillac what are you talking about when rudy flipped and you led him through the story you slipped you asked if the cadillac they were in was stolen yeah so howd you know it was a caddy it wasnt in the video that was sent to the times they stole it for that job and somehow you knew you said cadillac before rudy you knew what they were driving what are you doing here jerry you sent that video to the times you had cameras on gunn i was on my way to see mark taylor about it when i got shot you found the camera in the kitchen you got the murder on video it would turn this into a slam cameras inside were dead but not outside where it got them going up and in the cadillacs not in the shot harry dont tell me you sat there and just watched the tafero brothers pull up and go in and kill him oh man harry we do what we have to do what the fuck does that mean hollands a monster so was gunn the taferos we took them all off the chart jerry theyll never hurt anybody again but not like that brother not like that what has happened to you dont you see we cant be like them im not so sure anymore two weeks ago you didnt want to be my partner now im not so sure i can be yours we pleaded

seen a clip this is everything from when the officer gets out of the car until he leaves the scene larger context help people are gonna see what they want to see there is no good version of someone getting killed so how am i supposed to seat a jury much less try the case this exposes all of my potential witnesses to evidence of officer conduct before they can even be interviewed i thought you were all about police reform and transparency thats what i ran on and i am how many officerinvolved shootings have gone to trial in the last two decades please a clickbait statistic people trot out as if it proves something as if those cases were prosecutable but the facts covered up so youre saying they were all in policy go back look for yourself if i dont file on these guys how can i argue that

knob tried to get away with claiming hed never even been in the hallway he kept saying you set him up there are two kinds of truth mads kind that comes from darkness gets bent and manipulated for someones selfinterest and the kind you carry inside and know is real okay preston borders is a sociopath rape torture murder necklace she was wearing when he strangled her was found in his apartment we got the right guy  then why is  reopening the case eh new da wants to show shes a maverick like i said nothing to worry about mmm tasty what it needs paprika mm very funny  you guys pissed at me no

well actually there is and there were more women too that he was never charged with you ever hear the term testilying youre saying my dads lying no im not saying that im just saying sometimes cops

do you think that if a jury decides that you killed an unarmed man that that it end there just because it civil he wasnt unarmed well if chandler convinces them that he wa do you think for one second that irving wont take you off of the homicide table youll be doing auto theft in san pedro living on poptarts and instant ramen in a rented room okay look first of all lieutenant we dont even know

legit reason to bury a body up here especially a kid right femur city of bone the grid we laid down is like the block of a city so we know exactly what wa found where and every murder is the tale of a city who said that i dont know somebody think it true yeah i do detective bosch found it near the left wing of the pelvis probably in our victim pocket pretty good marker it put u inside year yeah two other thing i want to emphasize detective grave dept hand location terrain go ahead doc well we have a contradiction here it wa a shallow grave whoever buried this body basically covered it over with loose dirt and dry leaf which suggests panic poor planning on the other hand a remote location difficult terrain see what im saying premeditation yeah decomp fluid shave destroyed the clothing but the canvas backpack is largely intact so maybe burying it with the body wa a mistake maybe waistband from a pair of boy underwear pelvis assembly also indicates we may have a male here judging from the skeletal remains a child of about or give me the trowel brush missing lower mandible no teeth on the upper dental id would be too easy dont despair detective cranium show clear evidence of fracture line sand surgical healing hospital record another indicator were dealing with relatively contemporary bone stellate fracture on the occipital bluntforce trauma thats the most likely explanation ill

than luck and it count you know what you do it count shit crap i hate monday man you and me both brother shit seriously yeah im quitting for real we resume today where we left off friday m chandler direct examination of detective bosch you suspected mr flores of killing several woman is that correct he wa one of a number of suspect yes how many victim three were certain of possibly several more and how many suspect were you investigating in connection with these murder the task force wa investigating over a dozen or so roughly a dozen or so and you personally my partner and i were charged with investigating roberto flores did mr flores have a criminal record no had he ever even been arrested on any charge no wa mr flores ever arrested for these murder you know he wasnt your honor please answer the question detective no and why is that he died before he could be taken into custody you killed him he drew a gun on me so you say his weapon wa found at the scene wa his found on that weapon no wa it ever tied to him forensically in any way no is it possible someone else placed that weapon at the scene after you shot and killed him no objection sustained let turn to something you can prove wa there a pattern to these victim did they share any similarity they were all young asian or hispanic darkhaired similar height body type and who were they they were never identified you dont know their real name we do not and why is that it wa our supposition they were illegals working a prostitute their body had been stripped of all identification and we were never able to make any kind of forensic match and no one ever came forward to identify them or claim their remains no undocumented immigrant that wa our assumption prostitute a i said our best guess marginal vulnerable woman often victimized preyed upon would you agree yes you have sympathy for them i have sympathy for all the victim of the murder i investigate dont serial killer often target prostitute a you said theyre vulnerable and dont you have a particular interest in these sort of crime a personal interest i take each case a it come no one case or one kind of case matter to meany more than any other detective what did your mother do for a living she wa a prostitute your mother wa a prostitute yes is your mother still living no how old were you when she died how did she die she wa murdered and wa her murder ever solved no what happened to you after her murder i went in to the system youth hall foster home so the killer wa never caught never punished no detective when you shot and killed mr flores werent you in effect avenging your mother death objection youve got a lot of fucking nerve im way ahead of you mr belk counselor you know better i apologize your honor detective another outburst like that and ill hold you in contempt im sorry your honor it wont happen again strike that last question and response from the record howd it go chandler ambushed me somebody slipped her my file jesus gollihers ready for u if youre up for it after this bullshit the morgue will be a breath of fresh air we recovered about of the skeleton at the site given the shallow nature of the grave the rest of the remains were no doubt scattered by animal over the year is that enough more than enough in this case detective more than enough tell u what you got doc let start with the basic young male caucasoid comparison to maresh growth standard index put his age at approximately year old but this child wa a victim of severe prolonged physical abuse victim of chronic abuse often suffer growth disruption abuserelated stunting that skews age estimation what you get is a skeleton thats smaller than it should be the longlimb bone are shorter than one would expect how old is he really uh i would say best guess or time of death we have the coin which give u the early parameter of so you think he been in the ground since then year well we have surgical evidence that support the estimation of to year cause of death let save cause of death for last uh but before we get to that i want to give you an idea of what this boy had to endure during his short lifetime all right tell it your way doc well even with partial remains we have definitive proof of tremendous skeletal trauma and chronic abuse bone heal themselves through the study of bone regeneration we can establish a history of abuse on these bone there are multiple lesion and different stage of healing fracture old and new we only have two of the four extremity but both of them show multiple instance of trauma i counted distinct location indicating separate trauma and various stage of healing jesus christ and thats just the bone the damage that would have been inflicted on his vital organ and tissue it must have been tremendous without a doubt somebody kicked the shit out of this kid on a daily basis let me show you something the femur the upper thigh this line here where the color change is one of the lesion this boy suffered a powerful blow in the week before his death it didnt break the bone but it damaged it would no doubt have caused bruising and affected his walk somebody must have noticed you would think the right humerus show two separate and healed break one spiral fracture one bucket ah spiral fracture is the result of twisting the arm with great force bucket fracture is a result from pulling the arm with the same kind of violence the ulna the lower arm show a healed latitudinal fracture a parry fracture the break caused a slight deviation in the attitude of the bone you want to explain what that mean to my partner that mean the bone wa allowed to heal in place after the injury nobody took him to a doctor apparently not it a common accidental injury but it can also be a defensive one ward off a blow with the forearm because of the lack of medical attention my supposition is that this wa not an accidental injury but rather part of the abuse pattern i got to take a leak keep going sync and correction by solfieri www com', 'ive consulted on case all over the world bosnia kosovo world trade center this is a case maybe this boy wa better off leaving this world for a better one do you believe there a better world than this one i do when you were picking through the bone and burnt flesh at the world trade center that belief work for you then a a matter of fact it

cop did i wa with special force afghanistan wed go down in these tunnel in these cave pitchblack you turned your head lamp off and there wa this glow lost light we called it it wa like it wa trapped

yourself under control when the judge call your case the clothes were folded very neatly in the backpack three of everything shirt pair of sock pant underwear kid wa on his way somewhere whats that starshaped thing san diego aquarium now the brand name on two of the shirt is solid surf and the backpack ha got skateboard strap so maybe the kid wa into that and there a letter handwritten ink pretty bad shape well dry it out try some dye different light but dont get your hope up perfect murderedkid mystery press will be all over this look we dont want this backpack stuff in the newspaper okay you got it considering my unofficial status you want to handle medium relation nothing of value recovered and blah blah blah not too far from the truth right anything useful from sid nothing that id the kid what time are you due in court couple hour can you give u a minute irving called he is le than thrilled with what went on in court yesterday tell him he can kick pound in the ball for leaking my psych eval to chandler he asked me to talk to you you dont think it wa pound i think it suck but irving got a point im not admitting to shooting an unarmed man i didnt if chandler get paid she doesnt care what you admit irving say you can end this with no admission of guilt the city will settle the money is the admission you are a stubborn son of a bitch why you hold me in such high esteem who said that i do look im sorry this stuff came out in court about your mom that wa nobody business im not ashamed of her she had no family no husband she did what she had to do to raise me this is why i hold you in such high esteem because of who she wa and what she did the cop didnt give a shit and thats the reason whoever killed her is still in the wind they didnt care so maybe chandler right maybe on some subconscious level i shot flores to avenge my mother ill pretend i didnt hear that a to the plaintiff motion to exclude testimony about the evidence collected from mr flores home after his death no testimony concerning mr flores or his putative guilt or innocence shall be permitted do you wish to crossexamine the witness mr belk yes your honor remember harry yes or no not my first twirl around the dance floor counselor good to know detective bosch you testified that mr flores wa one of a dozen suspect in the investigation into these murder yes wa mr flores the leading suspect no did you shoot mr flores because you believed he had killed these three young woman no did you shoot mr flores because you believed that he wa a killer of prostitute no did you shoot mr flores to avenge your mother death no detective bosch why did you shoot mr flores i shot him because i believed he wa about to shoot me and after you shot him did you then place a gun in mr flores hand so a to retroactively justify your action no wa that possibility investigated by the lapd and the district attorney office and what did they determine that there wa no evidence whatsoever that i planted the weapon thank you detective m chandler redirect yes your honor detective bosch your partner testified that you broke lapd policy when you left him to pursue mr flores were you aware of the lapd policy regarding foot pursuit yes then why did you do it it wa a tactical decision please expound it made sense for one of u to pursue him on foot because we believed that he wa headed for the metro a belief that wa borne out by his subsequent action you consciously violated department policy in pursuit of a man you did not think wa a killer your honor asked and answered sustained m chandler is there a question one further matter detective when you saw mr flores enter that alley that night why did you pursue him why didnt you cal land wait for backup because of his evasive action entering the alley i thought flores might be on the prowl for a victim i didnt want to lose him werent you in fact hoping for a fatal confrontation that night no werent you in fact hoping to provoke mr flores to act in such a way that would justify shooting him no werent you in fact convinced despite your testimony that roberto flores wa the killer of these three prostitute no whoa i dont pay no income tax make too much howd it go i held my own i think boy nicholas trent lewd and lascivious you talked to him on the canvas he didnt make an impression guess he forgot to tell me he wa a convicted child molester it wa a question jerry not a judgment how should we do this you take lead i may wander this is not a good time im late for an appointment mr trent if you knew wed find out

manual nobody read the manual okay then keep this between u subordinate yes sir now discovery doesnt begin until you enter a plea but based on what we know from the arrest report the preliminary observation by the coroner and the charging document i think we can start formulating a strategy can i get copy of all that uh i would recommend against it you dont want this floating around in jail the wrong person get a look at it theyll snitch you off in a heartbeat make it sound like you gave up every detail i didnt kill that young man a man wa found dead in a vehicle owned and operated by you yeah and the preliminary coroner investigation call his death asphyxiation by strangulation yeah thats terrible but i didnt do it well it only get worse from there mr wait they found the hood and the taser those are tool that i use in my business and then there the blood hair semen collected from the victim body a well a but that prof it im not gay so it got to be somebody else a well a the van and the hood multiple distinct sample look my point is if even one of those sample from the hood or the van is matched to another murder or a missing person multiple victim make you eligible for the death penalty so what do i do you sit tight we enter a plea see whats in discovery maybe we get lucky and find something that we can challenge what if i had something what do you mean something to

you really think he our guy he a child molester doesnt make him a killer they all start somewhere yeah they do mr trent wa a pedophile with a criminal record he lived in close proximity to the burial site of a murdered child after being questioned by investigator he committed suicide whether mr trent wa responsible for the death of the victim is pending further investigation given that the is being blamed for trent suicide i think we can agree this press release will do nothing to help our situation it accurate we still dont know trent killed that kid now if we could modify the release indicate we think there a good probability trent wa the killer wed get the stink off pin the murder on the dead perv and walk away with a disney ending jesus christ bosch detective were not gon na pin the murder on anyone what make you think trent not our guy this child wa physically abused every day of his life more than likely the killer wa someone close to him a family member a friend a neighbor billet told me you found photo of kid he supported childrens charity solicitation the kind you get in the mail a day sends a bolivian kid to school we also found a box of tweener boy stuff toy game trent wa a set decorator he had all kind of stuff in his house maybe im missing something but it seems to me all of this point to trent okay case closed let all go get a beer go with the press release asis dont be confused whatever the defense would have you believe this case is not about a serial killer this case is only about the fatal shooting of a man named roberto flores a loving husband and father who wa shot to death one rainy october evening two year ago by detective harry bosch roberto flores wa unarmed roberto flores offered no resistance roberto flores had no criminal record detective bosch could have arrested roberto flores that night taken him into custody read him his right interrogated him given him the chance to obtain counsel and defend himself instead detective bosch for deeply personal reason of his own and in violation of procedure and policy deprived roberto flores of due process deprived him of his civil right and took his life lady and gentleman it very clear detective bosch under color of law broke every rule in the book when he killed roberto flores in cold blood thank you mr belk lady and gentleman when detective bosch encountered roberto flores in that dark rainy alley two year ago he had to make a splitsecond decision for u to secondguess his action now is impossible and unfair we werent there we didnt have to make that lifeordeath decision now mr flores ignored detective bosch order to put up his hand and keep them in plain sight he ignored detective bosch order to freeze and mr flores wa armed no one planted that gun in that alley that night that gun belonged to mr flores and no one else ooh merci beaucoup whats the occasion thanks for not getting her shitcanned i have no idea what youre talking about detective but i appreciate the brioche anything on the tip line yes there is um a guy from hemet called apparently the remains are extraterrestrial also uh sheila delacroix her brother arthur delacroix went missing in when he wa

friend you might i should have a talk with her yeah good idea all right thanks be safe so on the news this morning an unnamed source say that despite official denial nicholas trent is in fact

find him my father brought me home and he went to the police and reported him missing never heard anything back he just vanished off the face of the earth all these year i i just keep thinking you know one day hell just turn up all grown up and happy it always hardest around the holiday im sure what do you do for a living m delacroix um im a casting director mostly do you have any picture of arthur uh yeah that one that thats u on the end that one is uh more close to when he disappeared he about there these boy do you know their name oh sorry it been a long time you know they were his friend not mine but i do have one more you mind if we take these uh yeah if if you bring them back well make copy where did arthur have his surgery after the accident uh childrens hospital wed like to talk to your father is he still around samuel delacroix he in the valley manchester trailer park what about your mother oh she left u when we were little woke up one morning she wa gone you ever hear from her again not a word but uh she left little note under our pillow about how much she loved u and how this wa the best for everyone and crap like that you still have the note i threw it out you think arthur might have kept his im sure he did pitiful how he hung onto every scrap of her your mother name her maiden name christine dorsett i dont suppose you know where she is i dont even know if shes alive and i dont care what about a photo no but i do have one of my father oh his old head shot he wa an actor yeah guest shot mostly mannix marcus welby rockford he doesnt look like that anymore drink this backpack wa found at the burial site sorry uh dont remember this wa found in the backpack uh sh she gave this to him this wa like his favorite treasure he took it with him everywhere he even slept with it wa it a souvenir from a family vacation no um we didnt do thing like that she probably got it at some dollar store my god it might really be him we dont know for sure yet if we get his medical record we can compare that to his remains these stair oh yeah uh this is the home we grew up in so youve lived here your whole life well yeah i wa afraid if i moved if arthur came back he wouldnt know where to find me hey doc ah detective bosch sorry i couldnt come to the station thats okay you might find this interesting she wa pulled from the tar year old look familiar bluntforce trauma uhhuh not the only one we have a skull from another woman killed around the same time with the same stellate starshaped fracture so there wa a serial killer in this neighborhood year ago it quite possible i need you to look at this belonged to a boy named arthur delacroix who went missing in well let compare it with the laurel canyon skull the cranial surgery pretty sure theyre a match sister said the injury came from a skateboarding accident no not likely this is a focused fracture pattern a small area with surfacetosurface contact the location is high upon the cranium not in the back of the head which we normally associate with a fall so this injury the one that required surgery it the same kind of one that killed him yeah exactly deliberate not accidental in both instance this child wa struck with some force with a blunt object you have a photo of the boy yeah the malar and the superciliary ridge formation are consistent meaning i think this is your victim comparison with the sister should confirm it you asked me before if i had faith i remember i told you i didnt that wasnt the truth i do i have my own kind of faith blue religion arthur delacroix bone came out of the ground for a reason they came out of the ground for me to find them so i can put some part of this right thanks doc youre welcome harry harry i checked missing person from may of the boy dad never filed a report sheila delacroix said he did maybe he just told her he did what about arthur mother anything on her what you dont usually refer to the victim by their first name anyway she legally separated from samuel delacroix in filed for a divorce mental and physical cruelty remarried in she is now mr christine water palm spring bosch ricochet want to see you asap me why im sure hell tell

make a deal claim he buried several other victim up in that canyon say hell tell u where if we take the death penalty off the table life without parole dont do this do not make this deal give him the needle and send him down the hole where he belongs i dont love this either detective but he offering to tell u about all his victim we found at least seven profile in wait van six male one female now

funloving dad and me the disapproving disciplinarian mom first time ive ever been accused of being funloving look at the wait stuff you knew i would and when i heard the name raynard wait i thought it wa an alias there this character in medieval french literature reynard the fox reynard mean fox anyway he sly and selfish and he us his cunning to triumph over brute strength usually a dullwitted wolf put me the dullwitted wolf youre a cop so you symbolize brute strength so he taunt and call you because he reveling in outwitting you convinced he smarter than we are thats typical of psychopath anyway in the story he ha a castle where he go to hide a place where he wait so thing he took from the hardware store the sump pump the light these are all for his lair what about the mothball when i wa a kid my dad used to throw them under the house to get rid of the rat okay so basement or dungeon yeah now his familiarity with these folk tale is unusual for an american so he probably french or ha a french background or studied french in school look at this i wa looking into the coroner report the other detective characterize wait a homosexual but i dont think thats right prey on gay men prostitute hustler yeah but i dont think he see himself a gay or at least he deeply conflicted because look the two rape that we know of they were postmortem and they were brutal which mean he can only achieve an erection after the satisfaction of that rage any idea of the origin of that rage well murderer who exhibit this kind of behavior usually were sexually abused a child so my guess is he wa raped a a boy and what started out a revenge ha become a compulsion the hardware store jacking of the truck he breaking pattern he playing his endgame he like the risk the adrenaline rush the dare he want attention especially yours but i doubt youre gon na take this guy alive i dont think hell let you can i bring taylor to the kleiners party are we going did we i didnt did you mnhmnh i thought you werent speaking to tay that wa last month ill call gina the laus flew in last night oh god mr lau is a kleptomaniac no kidding she know exactly what shes doing the last time she wa here she nicked

it not doing anything to help u apprehend raynard wait i agree cooperation is always preferable to conflict which is why ive refrained from releasing my copy of the video your copy ahh i think that video cut both way dont you wait escape while in lapd custody well it certainly show you ordering detective bosch to loosen wait handcuff and once the shooting start the unsympathetic observer might conclude you were whats the word cowering behind escobar when wait fired the fatal shot what do you want irv you stand a good chance of becoming la next mayor i did until a few day ago well if we catch wait quickly youve still got the white west side a long a the video doesnt come out la is a threepiece suit black white and brown you need two out of three to get elected mayor in this town my endorsement would go a long way in the black community everyone know ive been a fierce critic of the current chief where is he from originally boston philly it crucial the next chief be a native

hand i dont know you do they didnt everything they found support stokes version of what happened not yours maybe i should have my league rep here sir im trying to save your job but you have to meet me halfway how do i do that detective bosch initiated a sexual relationship with you against department policy you need to report that relationship and file a complaint a complaint you felt pressured into the relationship because he wa your superior coerced you thought it would hurt your career if you didnt comply well technically he wasnt my superior and i didnt feel pressured it wa an inappropriate relationship according to department policy wa it not how doe filing a harassment complaint undermine his statement about what happened in the garage it doesnt it make it irrelevant no one downtown want to see a sex scandal in the paper especially involving bosch file the complaint withdraw your false statement and command buries your third unsat like it never happened but he didnt coerce me it wa mutual he fucked you brasher every which way bosch fucked you fucked you right out of your career with the you gon na let that stand can i think about it dont take too long meantime youre back on light duty thank you captain chief irving reverend can i give you the Â¢ tour oh im familiar with this church i used to come here every sunday with my parent of course i forget youre from the community i dont what can i do for you chief well actually i think there something we can do for each other im listening you could use your considerable charisma and your standing in the community to support richard osheas candidacy for mayor i thought you and he were mortal enemy alliance shift one ha to be flexible in this world well assuming the quid pro quo is what i think it is what would i get in return from you and the new mayor for my support assuming you deliver what would you want in return reverend a halt to gestapo tactic here on the street of south la to certain policing policy to racial profiling we are hardly the gestapo and overheated hateful rhetoric doesnt help my apology i only mean to say that it is in both our interest to avoid anything resembling a ferguson missouri situation here in la the last thing any of u want so we understand each other it appears so jesper whats so important you couldnt just send over a report i wanted to show you something i wa doing a final log on the delacroix evidence the backpack had skateboard strap right there wa no skateboard found at the grave site but there wa one collected from nicholas trent house we dismissed trent a a suspect no evidence connects him to arthur and he moved to that neighborhood two year after the kid wa killed i wa just looking to see if we missed anything before i sent it all to the property division so just to be thorough i thought id check to see if polyfibers from the backpack strap mightve got caught in the wheel assembly i didnt find any fiber but i found this this kind of board wa fancy back in the day most kid wouldve put their mark on it ad arthur delacroix god damn the year before he died nicholas trent had the kid board good work jesper we need photo of all this will do uh detective bosch yeah ill be right out i think i fucked up on the wait case how so i got a call here in the lab right after wait wa arrested guy said he wa from the da office sounded totally legit he said you guy hadnt turned in an evidence report yet and he needed to know what wa found at the grave site he couldnt get a hold of you and he wa up against a deadline jesus christ im really sorry he sounded so fucking real you told wait about the backpack what wa inside told him about the starfish that wa his get out of jail free card you have any idea what you did i do and i shouldve known better do you want me to resign what did he want to confess confess to what wait got ahold of a burner at pitch called jesper conned him out of the starfish stupid fuck you kicked his as didnt have to well bright side at least he solved the laurel canyon case for u how you figure clear a day trent had the board he took it from arthur after he killed him come on open your eye partner we were right about trent before we were wrong he lived with it all those year waited for that knock on the door one day it came we knocked on his door and he killed himself then go ahead and write it up damn youre back i start tomorrow what did pound want bosch head on a stick sound proper said the only way i can stay on the force is to file a sexualharassment complaint after what he did

just wrote about your latest case nothing new to comment on at this time following all lead et cetera et cetera well thats not why im calling then why a you probably know we keep a running tally of

murder of marjorie lowe detective bosch keisha it keisha right right keisha dont you think this woman read the article that came out during my trial and just looking for some attention of course thats

narcotic officer theyd been ripping off drug dealer shaking down merchant and all of this at the moment the investigation into my son death is focused on possible gang retaliation or that george did

good a it come at his job im sure he is when he allowed to do it but it campaign season bosch dirty cop killing a fellow officer are you saying theyd cover this up the mayor and his police chief

got ta understand tony wa washing all of joeys cash from the club the girl credit card drug like all of it thats a lot of skim to skim what did mark do ugh he drove to la and accused tony to his face of ripping him off which of course tony denied which is when nash and veronica figured the frame they overheard the fight it a smart play right tony get whacked everyone assumes it joey that put him down and then you show up at my place and you pull that gun out of my toilet im thinkin fuck this guy on joeys payroll he gon na frame me to take the fall yeah but what about all the cash they ever

woman wa murdered there seven month after my mother death another one wa found wrapped in a bedspread in an alley off selma six month after that the bedspread came from the city center hotel and the cause of death wa the same in all three the guy wa smart different mo different race on the victim the only connection is the hotel and that they were prostitute harry this is the longest of longshot exactly why i pulled the file to dig in and see maybe we should loosen his shackle bosch just do it how the fuck did the time get this forget it pal come on barrel when are you getting that knee looked after september till then he got the gag walk what do you think it mean above my pay grade cant say im sorry that it got out i think osheas run for mayor just took a tumble yeah huh okay im

nash crew and the mark crew what im focused on a a priority is the nash crew four weapon collected here here here and here this being where the submachine gun wa recovered and what do you have so far four different weapon one thing in common obliterated serial number most likely with a metal sander which still give u a halfway decent shot to restore the number with acid but it take time we dont have time lester you cant force science the acid we use to restore serial number take a few day minimum to do their magic but call me tomorrow maybe ill have something anything on the ammo i should know well we could pretty much match each weapon to the casing by caliber and location everyone on nash crew wa shooting reloads all four weapon correct nash is a firearm dealer make sense he might recycle his brass did you find a reloader at his house no we did not are you sure that coin you flipped came up head caffrey come in it you again yeah it me curry brand my favorite fox mitchell mr right to the point huh what wa the name you heard me fox mitchell um his name in the murder book no well then there your answer if it not in the book it not part of the case except you got an anonymous call about him from a woman after they found my mother murdered she gave you the hotel name room number where she wa killed doe that ring a bell now detective caffrey cant say it doe and how do you know i got the call could have been my partner could have been anybody she said she called the detective named in the newspaper you were the point man in the medium your name in every story the city center hotel room thats where she wa killed before he dumped her body you knew you were told dont tell me what i fuckin knew or what i wa told if it not in the book it not in the case end of story im gon na go out and smoke one of these cupcake and youre gon na get the fuck out of here all these year ive been coming to you asking about her case listening to your bullshit but i know now caffrey i know you took a dive dont you bring that shit in here dont you fucking dare i cleared murder case in my time you little shit so dont you come in here playing junior detective on my time who wa fox mitchell im telling you to get no im telling you she went to him that night she went to him and you knew you were told who wa fox mitchell who wa he fox mitchell wa an alias okay he wa a snitch a snitch for who major narcotic and you were told to lay off him i got the message yeah loud and clear he wa a prized and productive informant big arrest big seizure cocaine they wanted to keep him in place you didnt even talk to him off book i did the right thing i asked narcotic to make him available for questioning that request wa denied so you just laid down on it i had no choice fuck that no choice and what about his real name did you ever get it the asshole wouldnt give it to me and what about josephine ford and cindy black who the fuck are they murder victim like my mother never heard of them of course not you were too busy looking the other way bosch dont be so fucking judgmental you know the department you know how it work you get told to steer clear of something you steer clear or you get fucking rolled and how wa i supposed to know for sure that this guy wa even the killer she got killed and who get her case you my mother got you she never had a chance defendant allen up attorney conference now he went berserk yelling and screaming he picked up a pair of scissors so i i grabbed the closest thing i could put my hand on to defend myself and then he lunged at me and i i hit him with the trophy yes and how many time did you hit him once or twice i dont i dont really remember i wa terrified i thought he wa gon na kill me you feared for your life i did so is that enough i can work with this well dig deep into father tabakian find out all about him all his secret right now he the victim by the time we get to trial you will be yeah detective bosch m chandler didnt i say our path would cross again yes you did cause according to you im the kind of guy who cant stop stepping on his own dick and once again youve proven me right youre defending veronica allen she called i accepted thought it wa time to blow the dust off my criminal court skill highprofile case like this maximum medium perfect win or lose cant bill the city for this one from what i hear the lady near broke im not too worried about it i think she can scrape something together anyway it not about the money it the challenge and honestly when i heard your name catnip you two are made for each other i couldnt agree with you more how doe the defendant plead not guilty your honor not guilty were talking about ignoring exculpatory evidence the detective in this case ha a history of misconduct i proved that several month ago in the civil court and i fully expect to prove it again and so it begin it never ended man yeah what can i do for you thanks for the time i work hollywood homicide i know who you are here so im working a case cold case a string of murder late early a name keep coming up a a possible witness it turn out the name an alias for a ci who wa working for major this guy wa on keepaway status back then were looking at nearly year gone by so im thinking the ci probably not making case anymore and you want the name it got ta be in one of these snitch box right it doesnt matter how many year ago it wa you need command staff approval to access the ci file you have that what i got is a woman who wa strangled and left in a dumpster another one stabbed and a third one beaten to death and nobody gave a shit about it back then because the one guy who might know something about it wa making case for major narcotic when i wa a boot my to wrote me up three time for bullshit he wa one of those guy took great joy in bending people over ive known a few of those complete asshole which of course meant he rose through the rank wormed his way up to captain then i heard last year a detective in hollywood division threw his as through a plate glass window right in the fuckin watch office that really made my day we have a major operation going tonight i got here early to plan it out it gon na be a long one and i need to start stacking caffeine you want something from the break room ill probably brew a fresh pot itll take a while uh thanks i take it black okay back in a bit god damn you hey partner where you been downtown whats up i think ive got something here that we should take a look at run it firearm pulled number on the weapon nash and his crew were using at the bank only partial on two of them but full serial on the other two nash and ogradys beretta you run them through and here the thing both weapon were originally bought by nash under his federal firearm license bought legit completely legit and they were sold completely legit to a second party a hunting preserve and gun range up in canyon country okay according to but weapon were reportedly stolen last year during a burglary up at the hunting preserve they were among several gun reported stolen so they were stolen but then they end up back in the possession of the original dealer and somebody on his crew sound like a big coincidence doesnt it whats that word you like cahoot thats what this is exactly i mean nash sell gun to this place then he steal them back take off the serial number and give them to his crew i mean the original buyer he probably collecting insurance on the whole deal thats like laundering weapon and something else all of the ammo that wa used out there at the bank from these weapon reloads i mean every gun range ive been to ha a reloader or sell recycled ammo so we better go up there and talk to this guy maybe get a line on nash i mean that would be the plan except for this donald boehner died eight month ago natural cause i called up there at the gun camp a recording came on said theyre no longer open for business we check it out anyway yeah chain been cut probable cause work for me pull it over here well go the rest on foot im gon na grab the tube back up let wait and see what we got bosch im good i aint coming out here

the scene that they had quarreled over the money that mr allen had struck father tabakian with the trophy and then planted the scissors in his hand to make it look like selfdefense detective your partner testified that you told him from the beginning you believed the scissors were planted that is correct you never considered that her story of selfdefense might be true considered and dismissed detective werent you a defendant in a civil suit where you were accused of planting evidence yes what wa the outcome of that lawsuit the jury found for the plaintiff nothing further detective did the

of murder two the people of california versus veronica allen i declare a mistrial no jeopardy attache the defendant bond is released what doe that mean no jeopardy they can retry you thats not fair well dont worry about it yet let celebrate this victory this is a good thing ronnie this is not over detective seven to five for acquittal why would the next jury find you any more persuasive than this one did trust me the district attorney will weigh the odds and cut his loss the will retry ill make it my mission you are a dog with a bone and you mr allen are a liar and a murderer you really do need to get a life detective i still owe you that drink ring my bell any time ouch must be so sore by now most of the usable print belong to a william meadow military howd you know the tattoo howd

the owner of this little slice of heaven we think so any print besides meadow a multitude copper said the place wa ransacked after he died homeless on homeless right most likely the people case wa flimsy and the jury agreed bet it wa the men voted to acquit i hear you brother id acquit that any day they heard the testimony they found mr allen more compelling you guy do look shifty like a couple of saltandpepper shakedown artist preying on lonely widow shake this well were disappointed but this office will study the event of this trial before we decide whether to retry mr allen whether to retry are you kidding me that chickenshit excuse me mr district attorney benitez bosch anita wa just bringing me up to speed on the holland case all right i have to tell you after what happened today

on a uh phone call your honor in another room mr holland asked me if we had found what we were looking for i said no and a we walking outside he said and you wont either sound like he wa professing his innocence those were his word but that wasnt his tone of voice tone of voice your honor really let him finish what wa his tone taunting at that point mr holland wasnt officially a suspect so i took a wild shot i said you did it didnt you he smiled and said and ill get away with it too your honor no one else heard this alleged conversation except detective bosch and thats not all he said one more thing go on mr holland looked at me and said i am a god in this town detective and you dont fuck with the god preposterous your honor detective bosch ha a long history of investigative misconduct your honor a defendant own voluntary outofcourt statement are a hearsay exception and can be used against him at trial shes right mr fowkkes detective bosch fabricated this entire conversation and youre welcome to attack the credibility of the witness the jury will sort it out it called a trial no no no no no do not do the unringing the bell trope no do not go there not in my court your motion to suppress the testimony of detective bosch is denied death report on gunn be sure to tell bosch i omitted the part where he fucked up the crime scene with his print no way on a glass with whiskey in it harry always glove up apparently not always i saw him glove up jimmy lab dont lie j edgar i should probably tell billet but you know im not that kind of guy robertson writeup on gunn pretty thin guess an elephant hunter doesnt want to waste too much time with small game say you left print at the scene robertson full of shit never happened look at my screen harry it not just jimmy saying it it latent print ah shit i took off my glove to work my phone screen the picture i sent to oshea of the suicide note i must have moved the glass to get a clear shot is he being all selfrighteous about this yeah but he left it out of the report so there that you headed back downtown annabelle crowe dress rehearsal hows our meadow warrant oh im on it almost done youre not writing a novel the jury gon na wonder why you waited a year to call the police i wa embarrassed okay andrew holland is an important person in my business is that why you didnt show the bruise on your neck to anyone why you erased his voicemail message i just kept thinking like what if i had it wrong you know you hear about hollywood people weird sex i dont know maybe i wa just being a prude not chill enough about it okay dinner drink back to andrew holland house it all seemed perfectly normal yes we did some molly fooled around clothes came off consensual yeah but he didnt like me touching him he wanted to control everything after a while he moved behind me i felt his hand around my neck he squeezed i couldnt breathe did you tell him to stop i tried i couldnt i couldnt speak i tried to get out from under him but he wa too strong and then he wa he wa moving inside me and it wa all i could do to just and then nothing i blacked out i woke up alone in his bed naked on top of the cover i could hear the shower running i found my clothes in a bag in a black plastic garbage bag by the bedroom door my purse had been emptied out i saw my phone but i couldnt find my key i started to get dressed and i heard the shower stop i grabbed the whole bag and i ran out the door down the driveway through the front gate and i hid in the shadow and got dressed and i walked until i had cell phone reception so i could call a cab and why not the police right then he had already left me a voicemail on my cell worried about where id gone saying id forgotten my key and saying he wa sorry that thing had gotten carried away and he he thought i wa really into it he just wanted to satisfy me did he explain why he had to take a shower after hed choked you out what did you think the garbage bag meant the empty purse i dont know he wa getting rid of the evidence he thought you were dead bosch let her tell it her way i tried to forget about it but when i read about him being arrested for the murder of donatella spear i thought if i had said something she might still be alive no she wouldnt a guy like this keep stretching till he snap youre just lucky it wasnt you howd he seem bosch wound up really anxious to talk to that knucklehead bosch said gunn wa too drunk to talk yeah he wa out i felt bad when i called him gunn wa conscious otherwise i wouldnt have called him at home at that hour youve called bosch on gunn before oh yeah going back at least three four time on my watch j edgar hey coroner ruled gunns death a homicide somebody held him by the ankle and dropped him on his head congratulation mean i probably wont be able to protect harry from his fuckup with the print it gon na come up no doubt lady whoa good god man dont drink that you out of your mind ugh this is crate brew this shit taste like it fashioned from pencil shaving gugh here take that ugh all right jerry do not tell anyone green mountain kenyan i have to hide it from the hoi polloi okay so that my friend will set the world right on it axis and your bowel will thank me later probably like that yeah but if you turned it around if it wa like this if this mean anything why do you keep looking at that gunns now a murder drop seemed odd you still worrying over my print jerry youre not how wa crowe i dont know there something shes holding back about holland or herself somewhere in the intersection

the personal shit aside and get to it hey harry the kid that wa killed the other night by the hollywood bowl it connected to the meadow murder be a coincidence if it not wound indicate an expertise in killing knowledge of anatomy look military stabbed in the neck here hit the vagus nerve immobilizes the victim down stroke cut the bleeder two quick cut precise bled out in second wow jesus harry whered you learn that q corp special force close quarter combat i think the killer had spec ops training okay but why why kill the kid possible witness wa he he didnt see a thing uh i should have been more careful and not talked to him in public i put him at risk okay dont go there it go where it go detective join me no thanks this wont take long how long you looking at a job for the murder of edward gunn youve been told to shut it down im not shutting anything down it a coverup the suspect is not with the you lied to me i wa mistaken this is so fucked up i apologize you apologize fuck you this is my as what if i had run that story lucky you didnt ha if it come out that you falsely accused one of your own and how would that happen word get around dont fuck with me anderson veteran detective point finger at a fellow officer and then recants possibly under pressure whats really going on in the gunn case coverup thats my story go ahead and write it and ever department source you ever had will dry up like the la river the koreatown killer aka first became active four year ago half a dozen robbery assault four carjacking three shooting two murder incident occurring roughly every six month how do we know it the same guy every time same gun all three shooting print on one bike match print found on another victim vehicle from several scene eyewitness description pretty consistent too it the same guy and we still dont have a suspect not in the system never been arrested or served in the military or worked for the post office or taught school i get it always on a bicycle it his signature well why koreatown are these hate crime are they targeting korean we dont think so the victim have been white and black a well a korean he an opportunist not a racist he may just live in the neighborhood the latest carjacking victim helped u develop a new sketch let get this out to the public not a good idea sir well be overwhelmed with false sighting well keep it close circulate it internally it your call soon you wont have to sit through any more of these hows that the short list is getting shorter bradley walker want nestor delgado no comment you dont care i dont know where to start delgado he young he smart one of ours came up through the rank a rising star in the department thanks to friend in high place like walker he a climber not a cop plus he green he doesnt know what he doesnt know he not my first choice but besides i thought you couldnt appoint a latino that wa before the election now i can do whatever the fuck i want and you want delgado walker doe and the rest of the commission will go along youre playing me hector you know damn well delgado is not a good choice i want you irv but if you wont take the job grab those drink for me will you sharkeys mother blame herself do me a favor let her know about the victim assistance fund for the funeral cost done gentleman this is detective bosch he want to ask you a few question taco supreme wa sharkeys jam hey respect man sorry about your friend sure you are last time you saw sharkey you were running your flimflam right now we can cut you some slack on that but we need to know what happened that night anything you can tell u car he got into black beemer fuck what the fuck man there you go you do know something there only about a million of those douchey car around here did you make the driver couldnt really see him it wa with tinted window tall short black white anything this is how you do your friend look at this aw shit i dont want to see that look at this this is him killed like an animal and you play dumb i can kind of picture the dude in my head im not sure how to describe him then dont motherfucker keep your fucking mouth shut take this punk back to west hollywood and drop him on the street our pleasure give me that im going to show you some photo okay go ahead the driver may or may not be in the picture i dont want you to feel like you got to pick one maybe this one right here and him you sure could have been ill use a security guy to establish when donatella arrived and when holland left and came back that night the missing minute which will contradict his original statement to the detective when he wa staging the scene mmhmm after the security guy the evidence defense will say the sex wa consensual and well say that donatella thought she wa engaging in consensual sex but holland had intended to kill her all along intention it a high bar annabelle crowe will testify how he choked her during sex until she passed out and how his action afterwards indicate he thought she wa dead he wa prepared to get rid of her body excellent that establishes his homicidal proclivity the premeditation is there a problem shes nervous shit how nervous holland people let her know that they know she work a an escort witness intimidation i dont think it rise to that a far a we know they havent threatened her when did you speak to her last bosch is staying in touch with her it not going to be a problem word to the wise anita anything other than a professional relationship with detective bosch is a bad idea and not my style careful might be an sting s after

yeah you kill him no but somebody else did you have my card if you need anything yes i do yeah right this way you reliving your glory year bosch i maybe saw malibu once growing up from the window of a bus caffrey sent it to me from the grave sort of lawyer instruction in the event of death why would caffrey send you his high school yearbook dont know it not his either nobody named caffrey in it well before you get too hung up where are we on trevor dobbs just finishing up the filing package for the venturas got him on a bus to la county why dobbs lawyer called his client want to talk to you want to clear thing up thatll be a neat trick make sure you get audio for the jury if mr dobbs is guilty of anything it is of possessing money that ha not even been reported stolen that is the total of his involvement in this matter he can not be held responsible for the action of two contract employee who took it upon themselves to rip off some warlord in afghanistan he killed or ordered the death of william meadow cornell jackson xavi moreno and thomas niese a boy who never posed any threat to them oh bullshit that is fucking ridiculous that is a wild allegation detective and you have no proof of any of it no proof that xavi moreno is even dead in fact he the one you should be out looking for he on a beach somewhere in mexico while you falsely charge a war hero and an innocent man whyd your client try to kill me on the island i didnt know who wa hunting me you mightve been xavi sound like you knew what he wa up to detective we came to you today in good faith howd you know id work lateral and come in above you id have done the same it wa the tactically sound move hmm and suckered me into those trip line calculated risk the longer it went the le i liked my chance wheres the stern anchor the what from your boat im guessing it at the bottom of the pacific somewhere half the chain wrapped around xavi morenos neck again that is a completely unfounded assertion we found blood in the deck seam match that to moreno and maybe weve got a no body case maybe we dont well see well see know what your biggest mistake wa dobbs keeping the knife it wa hidden under the seat cushion oh hmm it not mine news to me the lab took it apart this morning they found blood under the pivot screw seeped in there where you cant clean it out if that blood turn out to be sharkeys it adios motherfucker for you thats not my fucking knife that wa xavis wa doesnt matter whose it wa it who ha it thats you you still have to explain why it wa on your boat in your possession when xavi moreno is supposedly on a beach somewhere in mexico yeah anything else you want to clear up counselor mr dobbs didnt think so you know there nothing worse than a leader who betrays his own troop in country that get you the death penalty right there but to kill a boy for what im going to make sure you live the rest of your life in the black echo you said you know who killed her he called himself mitch it the only name i ever knew him by the register are in the back in the cabinet mitch fox mitchell wa an alias okay he wa a snitch youve tied epperson to your mother murder i wa afraid i would find you here been a month without it talk to me bosch i shouldve fucking known arno epperson fox mitchell the man who murdered your mother or so i thought i mean i knew he wa protected by the department or somebody who had power over the department bradley walker he and arno were tight the police commission president his father more or le ran the city council for three decade why would bradley walker father run interference and protect epperson on a murder it doesnt make any sense that he would take that risk not for his son fuckup friend i know i had it wrong you had what wrong it wa the other way around it wa all about protecting bradley and arno epperson wa part of it youre saying bradley walker killed your mother im saying this isnt over im going to find out hello so you decided to return my property nice of you after a year and a half well the case ha been under investigation i needed to hang on to it a little longer oh you return it now so case solved still working it oh hey i remember you telling me that you were an employee here since back in summer of to be exact i want you to look at some picture mm no cant say a i ever seen him before you sure im not a hundred percent sure i mean it a long time ago how about these hmm mmmm mmmm mmmm oh yeah him who could forget that cocky mug he used to come here i remember chevy convertible party boy the paytoplay girl i had to tell him to keep it down more than a few time when oh uh same time late seventy eighty but not with this other guy no no he wa straight he liked the loose girl with the loose leg loose moral no i i didnt mean it that way i mean like did these two run together not that i remember but he rented room yep thats what were here for his name not in the book oh back then if people paid cash i never asked them too many question they could write down ronnie reagan for all i cared and some of them did nowadays everybody want to pay with plastic oh i check the s on that thanks yeah all right walker and epperson knew each other what doe it mean it mean i had it wrong i have a guy he identifies walker a a regular at the city center hotel the place my mother went the night she wa murdered my guy doesnt epperson but eppersons alias fox mitchell turn up repeatedly in the guest register and walker and epperson were asshole buddy since high school there no reason to think that they werent still hanging out in their walker know about eppersons life a an protected snitch with an alias he us eppersons alias to rent room at the city center hotel for liaison with prostitute so walker killed your mother now thats your theory do you have any idea how you sound i do but that yearbook came from caffrey say caffrey wa the target of the arson at river watch somebody wanted to wipe him out and whatever he had in that apartment but his lawyer had the yearbook yeah and caffrey kept a copy of my mother murder book somewhere else somewhere safe and found it so what do you want me to do bosch call tell them youve taken a personal interest in the case and ask for a briefing when they mention finding my mother murder book ask for a copy ill take it from there you want me to help you conduct a secret investigation of the man who is scheduled to pin the star on my collar dont you want to know if that man a murderer i got daddy bag i called it it not fair jack youre bigger be bigger ohh

accomplished you are in but in an outside kind of way for how much longer hows reggie i dont like keeping secret from him or maddie or harry bosch for that matter look jay i got you what you wanted were greedy bastard what can i say you can say welcome back to the bureau agent wish give me a desk and a badge soon i forgot what asshole you guy really are caffrey kept it in a safe deposit box extortion think so month ago caffrey started making deposit in his bank account in cash every month source unknown right after i went to him about fox mitchell yes so caffrey sends me in the wrong direction after epperson turn around extorts walker pay up or i give bosch the true story walker get tired of paying all theory no evidence if there evidence ill find it call me when you do wheres mom i dont know dad we need to go to the store the fridge is bare okay make a list ill take care of it mom is even worse about it than you are how did you two ever survive why do you think i know all the

you going stircrazy yet no im good look um ha bosch talked to you about this latest rabbit hole he going down he been dodging my call what now of course i want you there we just need to be discreet there is nothing inappropriate about this relationship i know that it just would you excuse me for a moment this wont take long hmm of course bosch back in caffrey got called to city hall to brief a councilman bradley walker sr on my mother case alone it in caffreys copy of the investigative chronology not in the official murder book is there a summary report on the briefing no nothing the murder book wa sanitized after caffrey met with walker a ive said this isnt proof of anything the mayor city council member they ask for briefing all the time walker senior name in the book doesnt add up to extortion or murder it walker i know it you know it otherwise caffrey wouldnt have sanitized the record i suggest you stand down detective and see where bennett and pell go with it theyll never get close to him it start with walker then you trace it back to the torch not the other way around bosch this is not your case it been my case since i wa year old did you ask bennett and pell for regular
